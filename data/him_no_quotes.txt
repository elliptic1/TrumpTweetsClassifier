3/7/2017 13:46:28	Twitter for Android	I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!

3/7/2017 13:13:20	Twitter for Android	For eight years Russia "ran over" President Obama, got stronger and stronger, picked-off Crimea and added missiles. Weak! @foxandfriends
3/7/2017 12:13:59	Twitter for Android	Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster - is imploding fast!
3/7/2017 12:04:13	Twitter for Android	122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision!

3/4/2017 12:02:48	Twitter for Android	How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!
3/4/2017 11:52:54	Twitter for Android	I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!
3/4/2017 11:49:00	Twitter for Android	Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!
3/4/2017 11:42:59	Twitter for Android	Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.
3/4/2017 11:35:20	Twitter for Android	Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!

3/3/2017 2:27:29	Twitter for Android	...intentional. This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed.....
3/3/2017 2:22:49	Twitter for Android	Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not....

2/16/2017 14:39:52	Twitter for Android	The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!
2/16/2017 14:10:49	Twitter for Android	FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast!

2/15/2017 12:19:18	Twitter for Android	Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia
2/15/2017 12:08:12	Twitter for Android	This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.
2/15/2017 11:40:32	Twitter for Android	The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC &amp; @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!
2/14/2017 14:28:54	Twitter for Android	The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?

10/17/2016 19:31:22	Twitter for Android	New polls are good because the media has deceived the public by putting women front and center with made-up stories and lies, and got caught
10/17/2016 16:12:24	Twitter for Android	Wow, new polls just came out from @CNN   Great numbers, especially after total media hit job. Leading Ohio 48 - 44.
10/17/2016 15:24:31	Twitter for Android	Voter fraud! Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word. Can you imagine if I got the questions?
10/17/2016 12:35:45	Twitter for Android	We have all got to come together and win this election. We can't have four more years of Obama (or worse!).
10/17/2016 12:33:48	Twitter for Android	Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!
10/17/2016 12:15:50	Twitter for Android	Can't believe these totally phoney stories, 100% made up by women (many already proven false) and pushed big time by press, have impact!

10/16/2016 22:15:33	Twitter for Android	Wow, interview released by Wikileakes shows "quid pro quo" in Crooked Hillary e-mail probe.Such a dishonest person - &amp; Paul Ryan does zilch!
10/16/2016 21:02:34	Twitter for Android	Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43!
10/16/2016 20:54:37	Twitter for Android	Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.
10/16/2016 20:47:23	Twitter for Android	The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton. We have Paul Ryan, always fighting the Republican nominee!
10/16/2016 17:01:12	Twitter for Android	The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD
10/16/2016 12:31:40	Twitter for Android	Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!

10/15/2016 22:49:18	Twitter for Android	The failing @nytimes reporters don't even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!
10/15/2016 18:29:22	Twitter for Android	Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me!
10/15/2016 12:23:08	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election
10/15/2016 11:45:58	Twitter for Android	This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!
10/15/2016 10:51:40	Twitter for Android	100% fabricated and made-up charges, pushed strongly by the media and the Clinton Campaign, may poison the minds of the American Voter. FIX!
10/12/2016 12:59:05	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton likes to talk about the things she will do but she has been there for 30 years - why didn't she do them?
10/11/2016 23:04:25	Twitter for Android	Wow, @CNN Town Hall questions were given to Crooked Hillary Clinton in advance of big debates against Bernie Sanders. Hillary &amp; CNN FRAUD!

10/11/2016 16:52:28	Twitter for Android	The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his  primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!
10/11/2016 14:15:10	Twitter Web Client	With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!
10/11/2016 13:05:53	Twitter for Android	Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.
10/10/2016 19:31:04	Twitter for Android	Wow, @CNN got caught fixing their "focus group" in order to make Crooked Hillary look better. Really pathetic and totally dishonest!
10/10/2016 17:22:22	Twitter for Android	Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee
10/10/2016 17:08:21	Twitter for Android	Thank you for all of the great comments on the debate last night. Very exciting!

10/10/2016 1:50:45	Twitter Web Client	Hypocrite! @HillaryClinton claims she needs a “public and a private stance” in discussions with Wall Street banks. #Debate
10/10/2016 1:36:24	Twitter Web Client	.@HillaryClinton : Bill “clarified” what he meant when calling Obamacare a “disaster.” Actually “disaster” is pretty clear. #Debate
10/10/2016 1:35:26	Twitter Web Client	We must repeal Obamacare and replace it with a much more competitive, comprehensive, affordable system. #debate #MAGA
10/10/2016 1:29:17	Twitter Web Client	Hillary’s 33,000 deleted emails about her daughter’s wedding. That’s a lot of wedding emails. #debate

10/10/2016 1:23:22	Twitter Web Client	There’s never been anyone more abusive to women in politics than Bill Clinton.My words were unfortunate-the Clintons’ actions were far worse
10/10/2016 1:13:03	Twitter Web Client	I’m not proud of my locker room talk. But this world has serious problems. We need serious leaders. #debate #BigLeagueTruth

10/4/2016 23:55:55	Twitter for Android	Wow, did you just hear Bill Clinton's statement on how bad ObamaCare is. Hillary not happy. As I have been saying, REPEAL AND REPLACE!
10/2/2016 23:45:40	Twitter for Android	Just announced that Iraq (U.S.) is preparing for battle to reclaim Mosul. Why do they have to announce this? Makes mission much harder!
9/30/2016 18:37:48	Twitter for Android	For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!
9/30/2016 12:50:48	Twitter for Android	Remember, don't believe "sources said" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist.
9/30/2016 9:30:11	Twitter for Android	Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
9/30/2016 9:19:25	Twitter for Android	Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.
9/30/2016 9:14:03	Twitter for Android	Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible!
9/30/2016 7:20:02	Twitter for Android	Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying "sources said," DO NOT believe it. There are no sources, they are just made up lies!
9/30/2016 2:16:00	Twitter for Android	Wow, did you see how badly @CNN (Clinton News Network) is doing in the ratings. With people like @donlemon, who could expect any more?

9/27/2016 1:36:50	Twitter Web Client	This is the simple fact about @HillaryClinton: she is a typical politician - all talk, no action. #Debates2016
9/27/2016 1:28:50	Twitter Web Client	.@HillaryClinton has been part of the rigged DC system for 30 years? Why would we take policy advice from her? #Debates2016
9/27/2016 1:23:43	Twitter Web Client	.@HillaryClinton channels John Kerry on trade: she was for bad trade deals before she was against them. #TPP #Debates2016
9/27/2016 1:18:55	Twitter Web Client	.@HillaryClinton and Obama policies increased debt by $9trillion over the last 8 years

9/25/2016 13:04:46	Twitter for Android	Bernie Sanders gave Hillary the Dem nomination when he gave up on the e-mails. That issue has only gotten bigger!
9/25/2016 12:30:28	Twitter for Android	Many on the team and staff of Bernie Sanders have been treated badly by the Hillary Clinton campaign - and they like Trump on trade, a lot!
9/24/2016 12:35:02	Twitter for Android	The @SenTedCruz endorsement was a wonderful surprise. I greatly appreciate his support! We will have a tremendous victory on November 8th.
9/24/2016 2:09:56	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand. Dem pols said no way, dumb!

9/17/2016 22:57:09	Twitter for Android	My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now), but they are watching. Really disgusting
9/17/2016 21:38:50	Twitter for Android	The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly. They are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag!
9/17/2016 13:13:43	Twitter for Android	.@CNN just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life!
9/17/2016 11:51:41	Twitter for Android	I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!
9/17/2016 5:53:09	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not!

9/14/2016 3:21:34	Twitter for Android	Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years. Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass?

9/13/2016 0:35:11	Twitter for Android	Just got back from Asheville,  North Carolina, where we had a massive rally. The spirit of the crowd was unbelievable. Thank you!  #MAGA

9/10/2016 18:18:37	Twitter for Android	While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!
9/10/2016 15:54:27	Twitter for Android	Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!
9/10/2016 12:47:18	Twitter for Android	Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!

9/10/2016 5:47:11	Twitter for Android	Dummy writer @tonyschwartz, who wanted to do a second book with me for years (I said no), is now a hostile basket case who feels jilted!
9/9/2016 17:32:36	Twitter Web Client	Henry McMaster, Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly. Funny!
9/9/2016 14:42:56	Twitter Web Client	Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.
9/9/2016 14:37:53	Twitter Web Client	.@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. Theyare a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.
9/9/2016 4:10:49	Twitter for Android	The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!
9/8/2016 15:17:47	Twitter Web Client	Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!
9/8/2016 12:10:13	Twitter for Android	A rough night for Hillary Clinton  ABC News.
9/8/2016 10:52:27	Twitter for Android	Wow, reviews are in - THANK YOU!
9/8/2016 10:43:12	Twitter for Android	COMING UP @GenFlynn @newtgingrich on @foxandfriends

9/8/2016 4:02:15	Twitter for Android	Thank you to our fantastic veterans. The reviews and polls from almost everyone of my Commander-in-Chief presentation were great. Nice!
9/6/2016 11:12:11	Twitter for Android	China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!
9/6/2016 11:00:56	Twitter for Android	The truly great Phyllis Schlafly, who honored me with her strong endorsement for president, has passed away at 92. She was very special!
9/4/2016 23:26:41	Twitter for Android	To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. I will fix it, VOTE "T"
9/4/2016 23:17:38	Twitter for Android	The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
9/4/2016 23:05:24	Twitter for Android	The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad!
9/4/2016 22:05:29	Twitter for Android	The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
9/4/2016 16:04:21	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!
9/4/2016 12:55:58	Twitter for Android	Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source
9/3/2016 20:36:39	Twitter for Android	.@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.
9/3/2016 20:33:36	Twitter for Android	Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!
9/2/2016 12:35:44	Twitter for Android	I visited our Trump Tower campaign headquarters last night, after returning from Ohio and Arizona, and it was packed with great pros - WIN!
9/2/2016 12:32:31	Twitter for Android	People will be very surprised by our ground game on Nov. 8. We have an army of volunteers and people with GREAT SPIRIT! They want to #MAGA!
9/2/2016 12:28:58	Twitter for Android	Just heard that crazy and very dumb @morningmika had a mental breakdown while talking about me on the low ratings @Morning_Joe. Joe a mess!
9/1/2016 10:46:44	Twitter for Android	Poll numbers way up - making big progress!
9/1/2016 10:40:13	Twitter for Android	Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great review of the speech on immigration last night. Thank you also to the great people of Arizona!
9/1/2016 10:31:17	Twitter for Android	Mexico will pay for the wall!
9/1/2016 0:43:00	Twitter for Android	Great trip to Mexico today  - wonderful leadership and high quality people! Look forward to our next meeting.
8/31/2016 13:07:38	Twitter for Android	Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the "f bomb."
8/30/2016 10:27:21	Twitter for Android	From day one I said that I was going to build a great wall on the SOUTHERN BORDER, and much more. Stop illegal immigration. Watch Wednesday!
8/29/2016 13:35:31	Twitter for Android	Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want TRUMP!
8/29/2016 13:30:04	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT
8/29/2016 13:23:02	Twitter for Android	Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere
8/27/2016 14:17:14	Twitter for Android	Heroin overdoses are taking over our children and others in the MIDWEST. Coming in from our southern border. We need strong border &amp; WALL!
8/26/2016 17:14:09	Twitter for Android	How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth "SUPER PREDATORS" - Has she apologized?
8/26/2016 16:01:03	Twitter for Android	I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve
8/26/2016 14:50:06	Twitter for Android	Wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @MSNBC by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @Morning_Joe. Apologize!
8/26/2016 14:20:55	Twitter for Android	What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty, crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!
8/26/2016 13:50:42	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to solve the problems of poverty, education and safety within the African-American &amp; Hispanic communities
8/26/2016 2:40:04	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy, and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!
8/25/2016 12:44:55	Twitter for Android	So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise
8/25/2016 12:34:58	Twitter for Android	Poll numbers are starting to look very good. Leading in Florida @CNN Arizona and big jump in Utah. All numbers rising, national way up. Wow!
8/23/2016 14:46:58	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton strongly stated  that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE!
8/23/2016 13:53:11	Twitter for Android	It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact,  that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!
8/23/2016 12:56:46	Twitter for Android	I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a @FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime!
8/22/2016 23:46:42	Twitter for Android	Just leaving Akron, Ohio, after a packed rally. Amazing people! Going now to Texas.
8/22/2016 12:31:39	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. Eastern. ENJOY!
8/22/2016 11:29:13	Twitter for Android	Some day, when things calm down, I'll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure long-time girlfriend, @morningmika. Two clowns!
8/22/2016 11:21:53	Twitter for Android	Tried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning,  unwatchable! @morningmika is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!
8/22/2016 1:08:08	Twitter for Android	I heard that @Morning_Joe was very nice on Friday but that little Donny D, a big failure in TV (&amp; someone I helped), was nasty. Irrelevant!
8/22/2016 0:33:38	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her!
8/21/2016 23:35:17	Twitter for Android	I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them. Something very big is happening!
8/20/2016 23:02:37	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed on @JudgeJeanine at 9:00 P.M. Enjoy!
8/20/2016 22:57:23	Twitter for Android	Just leaving Virginia - really big crowd, great enthusiasm!
8/15/2016 1:34:25	Twitter for Android	Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
8/15/2016 0:07:43	Twitter for Android	Stay on message is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
8/14/2016 23:57:37	Twitter for Android	I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
8/14/2016 17:06:20	Twitter for Android	It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
8/14/2016 16:55:07	Twitter for Android	I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
8/14/2016 16:50:51	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
8/14/2016 12:46:17	Twitter for Android	My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
8/14/2016 12:37:37	Twitter for Android	If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
8/14/2016 12:31:23	Twitter for Android	The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said
8/14/2016 12:24:48	Twitter for Android	The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!
8/13/2016 20:02:38	Twitter for Android	We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.
8/13/2016 18:39:26	Twitter for Android	I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
8/13/2016 18:29:23	Twitter for Android	The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!
8/12/2016 13:01:06	Twitter for Android	ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!
8/12/2016 11:43:43	Twitter for Android	I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!
8/12/2016 11:07:51	Twitter for Android	A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!
8/12/2016 10:26:20	Twitter for Android	Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS, &amp; MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?
8/10/2016 15:08:01	Twitter for Android	.@dbongino  You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on @CNN. Don Lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock
8/10/2016 1:11:39	Twitter Web Client	When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?
8/9/2016 11:59:25	Twitter for Android	I am running against the Washington insiders, just like I did in the Republican Primaries. These are the people that have made U.S. a mess!
8/9/2016 11:32:43	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends now!
8/9/2016 2:45:10	Twitter for Android	Being in Detroit today was wonderful. Quick stop in Ohio to meet with some of our great supporters. Just got back home!
8/8/2016 15:20:44	Twitter for Android	My economic policy speech will be carried live at 12:15 P.M. Enjoy!
8/7/2016 23:09:08	Twitter for Android	Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!
8/7/2016 21:31:46	Twitter for Android	The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, "the baby" and so much more. Very dishonest!
8/7/2016 13:49:29	Twitter for Android	I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke!
8/7/2016 1:53:45	Twitter for Android	I am not just running against Crooked Hillary Clinton, I am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media - but I will win!
8/6/2016 18:11:50	Twitter for Android	Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED, and other things!
8/6/2016 14:48:14	Twitter for Android	Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED."
8/6/2016 14:24:43	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!
8/6/2016 11:53:00	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!
8/5/2016 10:39:27	Twitter for Android	The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!
8/3/2016 10:23:27	Twitter for Android	Our incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran. Scandal!
8/3/2016 9:14:40	Twitter for Android	There is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before. I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support. Beat Crooked H!
8/3/2016 2:51:00	Twitter for Android	Great day in Virginia. Crowd was fantastic!
8/2/2016 19:07:25	Twitter for Android	President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!
8/1/2016 13:03:02	Twitter for Android	So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
8/1/2016 12:50:32	Twitter for Android	When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!
8/1/2016 11:27:43	Twitter for Android	This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
8/1/2016 11:10:51	Twitter for Android	Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
8/1/2016 0:57:15	Twitter for Android	Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!
7/31/2016 20:09:00	Twitter for Android	The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
7/31/2016 13:32:55	Twitter for Android	I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!
7/31/2016 12:57:21	Twitter for Android	Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!
7/31/2016 3:32:40	Twitter for Android	Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!
7/30/2016 23:00:07	Twitter for Android	Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.
7/30/2016 22:28:22	Twitter for Android	Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews
7/30/2016 22:18:58	Twitter for Android	Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!
7/30/2016 22:12:36	Twitter for Android	The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!
7/30/2016 22:04:14	Twitter for Android	Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP
7/30/2016 21:51:25	Twitter for Android	Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
7/30/2016 20:01:32	Twitter for Android	I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!
7/30/2016 19:55:26	Twitter for Android	Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings
7/30/2016 16:29:17	Twitter for Android	Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!
7/29/2016 17:43:52	Twitter for Android	I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!
7/29/2016 17:03:56	Twitter for Android	Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!
7/29/2016 16:56:30	Twitter for Android	The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!
7/29/2016 14:14:25	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!
7/29/2016 14:06:38	Twitter for Android	If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary
7/29/2016 13:59:42	Twitter for Android	Little Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!
7/29/2016 13:53:31	Twitter for Android	General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary
7/29/2016 13:44:54	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!
7/29/2016 13:13:07	Twitter for Android	Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!
7/29/2016 12:51:13	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
7/29/2016 12:40:10	Twitter for Android	The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
7/28/2016 15:09:11	Twitter Web Client	President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesn’t exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #DNC
7/27/2016 13:01:03	Twitter for Android	Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
7/27/2016 12:57:20	Twitter for Android	Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
7/27/2016 10:08:35	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
7/27/2016 10:01:39	Twitter for Android	Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
7/27/2016 9:50:55	Twitter for Android	The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
7/27/2016 9:43:16	Twitter for Android	Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!
7/27/2016 9:33:52	Twitter for Android	As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
7/27/2016 2:11:47	Twitter for Android	Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
7/27/2016 2:08:50	Twitter for Android	I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
7/27/2016 2:02:24	Twitter for Android	No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!
7/27/2016 1:51:45	Twitter for Android	You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly
7/26/2016 22:50:12	Twitter for Android	For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.
7/26/2016 22:47:28	Twitter for Android	In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
7/26/2016 12:42:33	Twitter for Android	Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.
7/26/2016 12:38:27	Twitter for Android	Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
7/26/2016 12:34:19	Twitter for Android	Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference
7/26/2016 3:19:38	Twitter for Android	Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
7/26/2016 3:12:57	Twitter for Android	Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
7/25/2016 21:57:14	Twitter for Android	I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
7/25/2016 21:45:54	Twitter for Android	Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
7/25/2016 14:05:27	Twitter for Android	Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA
7/25/2016 14:01:25	Twitter for Android	The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
7/25/2016 13:47:45	Twitter for Android	Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
7/25/2016 13:42:55	Twitter for Android	Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
7/25/2016 13:19:18	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
7/25/2016 12:27:35	Twitter for Android	If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
7/25/2016 12:02:01	Twitter for Android	Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
7/25/2016 11:57:17	Twitter for Android	How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
7/25/2016 11:31:22	Twitter for Android	The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me
7/24/2016 23:59:10	Twitter for Android	Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!
7/24/2016 23:47:08	Twitter for Android	The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
7/24/2016 22:33:42	Twitter for Android	The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
7/24/2016 22:16:59	Twitter for Android	The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!
7/24/2016 22:07:49	Twitter for Android	Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
7/24/2016 22:02:42	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
7/24/2016 21:53:29	Twitter for Android	If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
7/24/2016 20:45:31	Twitter for Android	The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
7/24/2016 20:30:06	Twitter for Android	I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
7/24/2016 13:30:59	Twitter for Android	Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
7/24/2016 13:27:56	Twitter for Android	There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
7/24/2016 12:30:15	Twitter for Android	An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
7/24/2016 12:15:51	Twitter for Android	Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
7/24/2016 11:56:43	Twitter for Android	Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
7/24/2016 11:25:06	Twitter for Android	Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
7/24/2016 11:16:15	Twitter for Android	The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!
7/23/2016 22:05:55	Twitter for Android	Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
7/23/2016 20:43:33	Twitter for Android	Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
7/23/2016 16:06:15	Twitter for Android	I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
7/23/2016 15:36:41	Twitter for Android	Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
7/23/2016 15:01:48	Twitter for Android	Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
7/23/2016 14:51:32	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
7/23/2016 10:55:20	Twitter for Android	Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
7/23/2016 10:42:10	Twitter for Android	Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
7/23/2016 10:35:37	Twitter for Android	Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
7/23/2016 10:31:18	Twitter for Android	The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
7/23/2016 3:49:04	Twitter for Android	I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
7/23/2016 3:23:15	Twitter for Android	Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
7/22/2016 23:03:19	Twitter for Android	Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.
7/22/2016 14:06:01	Twitter for Android	One of the best produced, including the incredible stage &amp; set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove
7/22/2016 13:13:02	Twitter for Android	Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!
7/22/2016 13:07:51	Twitter for Android	What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!
7/21/2016 14:49:19	Twitter for Android	Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena!
7/21/2016 14:12:45	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!
7/21/2016 12:37:53	Twitter for Android	I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight!
7/21/2016 3:56:28	Twitter for Android	Arena was packed, totally electric!
7/21/2016 3:53:28	Twitter for Android	.@mike_pence was fantastic tonight. Will be a great V.P.
7/21/2016 3:45:48	Twitter for Android	Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!
7/21/2016 1:52:25	Twitter Ads	#TextTrump88022 for exclusive @realDonaldTrump updates!  We will Make America Great Again!
7/21/2016 1:24:26	Twitter for Android	Thank you to Governor @ScottWalker for such warm support. Great speech!
7/20/2016 18:48:11	Twitter for Android	John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!
7/20/2016 15:36:06	Twitter Web Client	The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
7/20/2016 15:31:15	Twitter Web Client	Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
7/20/2016 12:51:58	Twitter for Android	In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!
7/20/2016 12:47:56	Twitter for Android	Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.
7/20/2016 10:18:17	Twitter for Android	Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!
7/19/2016 23:52:59	Twitter for Android	Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!
7/19/2016 22:12:56	Twitter for Android	The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!
7/18/2016 20:51:55	Twitter for Android	Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!
7/18/2016 20:48:00	Twitter for Android	.@CNN is the worst.They go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump! VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!
7/18/2016 17:28:04	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, Melania. Place looks beautiful!
7/17/2016 21:26:50	Twitter for Android	President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!
7/17/2016 21:22:23	Twitter for Android	Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough!
7/17/2016 18:39:36	Twitter for Android	I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 7:00 P.M. with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects! Bad times for divided USA!
7/17/2016 18:26:51	Twitter for Android	We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching
7/17/2016 13:09:02	Twitter for Android	The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like
7/17/2016 13:04:10	Twitter for Android	.@FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.
7/17/2016 12:24:04	Twitter for Android	If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H
7/17/2016 12:14:46	Twitter for Android	I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!
7/17/2016 12:06:18	Twitter for Android	It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!
7/17/2016 11:55:21	Twitter for Android	As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!
7/17/2016 4:19:05	Twitter for Android	We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!
7/17/2016 4:15:49	Twitter for Android	Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over
7/17/2016 3:39:09	Twitter for Android	Thank you to Jack Morgan, Tamara Neo, Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!
7/17/2016 3:15:22	Twitter for Android	Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing. I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
7/16/2016 13:23:17	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!
7/16/2016 13:19:11	Twitter for Android	Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
7/16/2016 13:13:56	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!
7/16/2016 13:08:43	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done
7/16/2016 12:29:43	Twitter for Android	Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!
7/16/2016 2:12:13	Twitter for Android	Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City.

7/15/2016 14:41:20	Twitter for Android	Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O &amp; Hillary!
7/15/2016 14:31:18	Twitter for Android	#NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
7/14/2016 23:09:57	Twitter for Android	In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.
7/14/2016 22:40:31	Twitter for Android	Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.
7/13/2016 4:54:40	Twitter for Android	Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!
7/12/2016 13:39:56	Twitter for Android	I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
7/12/2016 13:36:47	Twitter for Android	Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!
7/12/2016 11:58:58	Twitter for Android	Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!
7/10/2016 18:58:10	Twitter for Android	I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily, few people are watching - dead network!
7/10/2016 18:42:32	Twitter for Android	The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!
7/10/2016 18:27:58	Twitter for Android	President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
7/10/2016 12:02:02	Twitter for Android	Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!
7/9/2016 15:18:58	Twitter for Android	Way to go @serenawilliams  - you are a true champion. Proud of you!
7/8/2016 11:02:41	Twitter for Android	Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country
7/8/2016 1:52:04	Twitter for Android	After today, Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.
7/7/2016 18:07:28	Twitter for Android	Just leaving D.C. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!
7/6/2016 15:32:35	Twitter Web Client	Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
7/6/2016 14:06:38	Twitter for Android	I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics
7/6/2016 14:01:09	Twitter for Android	Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.
7/6/2016 13:24:50	Twitter for Android	Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
7/6/2016 13:12:43	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City
7/6/2016 13:08:44	Twitter for Android	I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
7/6/2016 12:31:27	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!
7/6/2016 11:21:34	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
7/6/2016 11:12:45	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!
7/6/2016 4:36:31	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
7/6/2016 4:30:04	Twitter for Android	I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out!
7/6/2016 4:23:03	Twitter for Android	Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
7/5/2016 18:36:15	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while. We will be traveling to North Carolina together today.
7/5/2016 15:39:06	Twitter Web Client	FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
7/5/2016 15:37:23	Twitter Web Client	The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.
7/5/2016 12:05:46	Twitter for Android	It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
7/5/2016 11:14:58	Twitter for Android	Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
7/4/2016 22:59:46	Twitter for Android	On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy!
7/4/2016 22:30:15	Twitter for Android	Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
7/4/2016 15:34:15	Twitter for Android	With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
7/4/2016 15:26:56	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
7/4/2016 14:25:04	Twitter for Android	The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
7/4/2016 14:19:13	Twitter for Android	I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!
7/4/2016 14:11:09	Twitter for Android	Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people!
7/4/2016 13:56:34	Twitter for Android	Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!
7/4/2016 13:42:16	Twitter for Android	Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!
7/4/2016 12:00:11	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
7/4/2016 11:54:40	Twitter for Android	The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
7/4/2016 11:35:16	Twitter for Android	In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
7/3/2016 21:46:58	Twitter for Android	I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
7/3/2016 21:43:25	Twitter for Android	The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."
7/3/2016 21:38:20	Twitter for Android	Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
7/3/2016 21:00:39	Twitter for Android	THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!
7/3/2016 20:47:51	Twitter for Android	On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
7/3/2016 20:20:20	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!
7/3/2016 20:16:23	Twitter for Android	Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
7/3/2016 17:40:49	Twitter for Android	Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!
7/2/2016 21:13:02	Twitter for Android	It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
7/2/2016 20:39:39	Twitter for Android	It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!
7/2/2016 11:55:14	Twitter for Android	The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release
7/2/2016 11:48:18	Twitter for Android	Just read in the failing @nytimes that I was not aware "the event had to be held in Cleveland" - a total lie. These people are sick!
7/2/2016 1:19:46	Twitter for Android	Just returned from Colorado. Amazing crowd!
6/30/2016 17:32:20	Twitter Web Client	New book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read! #WakeUpAmerica
6/30/2016 2:39:36	Twitter for Android	For reasons only they can explain, the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.
6/30/2016 2:30:59	Twitter for Android	Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!
6/29/2016 22:57:44	Twitter for Android	I will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
6/29/2016 14:37:37	Twitter for Android	Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews - He was great! Thank you John.
6/29/2016 13:14:56	Twitter for Android	Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?
6/29/2016 13:09:49	Twitter for Android	The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts
6/29/2016 2:55:50	Twitter for Android	Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!
6/28/2016 21:10:57	Twitter Web Client	We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
6/28/2016 21:08:51	Twitter Web Client	Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey. Willthe world ever realize what is going on? So sad.
6/28/2016 20:26:22	Twitter Web Client	Hillary Clinton’s Presidency would be catastrophic forthe future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.
6/28/2016 20:24:13	Twitter Web Client	Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It justnever seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.
6/27/2016 13:39:12	Twitter for Android	.@CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don't watch it anymore.
6/27/2016 13:18:12	Twitter for Android	The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong), watch November
6/27/2016 13:07:04	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.
6/26/2016 23:13:25	Twitter for Android	The "dirty" poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good.
6/26/2016 22:15:40	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time
6/26/2016 22:09:30	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune, I am spending very little. Close in polls!
6/26/2016 21:21:50	Twitter for Android	People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!
6/26/2016 16:21:15	Twitter for Android	The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!
6/26/2016 16:06:23	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support son
6/26/2016 11:36:14	Twitter for Android	Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
6/26/2016 11:33:17	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.
6/26/2016 11:24:00	Twitter for Android	George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls
6/26/2016 3:32:05	Twitter for Android	Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget!
6/25/2016 12:00:29	Twitter for Android	So funny, Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk, no action!
6/23/2016 13:17:35	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.  --   Donald J. Trump
6/23/2016 13:13:22	Twitter for Android	Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying."
6/22/2016 19:00:47	Twitter Web Client	Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou
6/22/2016 3:16:27	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
6/21/2016 20:44:00	Twitter Web Client	I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET
6/21/2016 17:19:22	Twitter Web Client	Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.
6/21/2016 17:17:49	Twitter Web Client	If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty &amp; judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.
6/21/2016 17:16:14	Twitter Web Client	Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
6/21/2016 16:55:41	Twitter for Android	I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.
6/21/2016 16:42:47	Twitter Web Client	How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
6/21/2016 16:38:07	Twitter Web Client	Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% asSecretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.
6/21/2016 16:36:40	Twitter Web Client	Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.
6/21/2016 14:22:08	Twitter Web Client	I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
6/21/2016 10:38:49	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!
6/20/2016 10:24:12	Twitter for Android	When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees

6/14/2016 12:26:49	Twitter for Android	American must now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant. We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.
6/13/2016 15:08:20	Twitter for Android	I am watching @FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words, and @CNN, and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying
6/13/2016 15:03:29	Twitter for Android	I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 P.M.
6/13/2016 14:59:25	Twitter for Android	I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!
6/12/2016 20:47:36	Twitter for Android	What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough
6/12/2016 12:07:22	Twitter for Android	Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.
6/11/2016 23:28:13	Twitter for Android	Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career. Very racist!
6/11/2016 12:00:26	Twitter for Android	Don King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!
6/11/2016 11:18:19	Twitter for Android	Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is

6/10/2016 15:10:22	Twitter for Android	The great boxing promoter, Don King, just endorsed me. Nice!
6/10/2016 12:07:49	Twitter for Android	Pocahontas is at it again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, one of the least productive U.S. Senators, has a nasty mouth. Hope she is V.P. choice.
6/9/2016 18:22:21	Twitter Web Client	Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama—but nobody else does!
6/9/2016 12:29:24	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else. Obama plus!
6/9/2016 12:11:55	Twitter for Android	As expected, the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win!
6/9/2016 1:46:03	Twitter for Android	Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters, because of trade, will come to me.
6/9/2016 0:54:44	Twitter for Android	I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents, she had one!
6/8/2016 12:08:55	Twitter for Android	Nobody is watching @Morning_Joe anymore. Gone off the deep end - bad ratings. You won't believe what I am watching now!
6/8/2016 0:41:42	Twitter for Android	I will be speaking about our great journey to the Republican nomination at 9:00 P.M. The movement toward a country that WINS again continues

6/7/2016 2:21:08	Twitter for Android	In just out book, Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!
6/7/2016 1:51:12	Twitter for Android	A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC &amp; VIOLENT. Bad temperament for pres
6/6/2016 13:42:53	Twitter for Android	A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!
6/6/2016 13:23:54	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!
6/6/2016 13:15:19	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
6/6/2016 12:56:07	Twitter for Android	Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great!
6/6/2016 11:23:54	Twitter for Android	People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign, but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media!
6/5/2016 22:15:01	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!
6/5/2016 21:56:01	Twitter for Android	I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!
6/5/2016 21:36:48	Twitter for Android	The Clinton News Network, sometimes referred to as @CNN, is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors
6/4/2016 13:14:26	Twitter for Android	We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.
6/4/2016 13:11:09	Twitter for Android	The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the  protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!
6/4/2016 13:04:33	Twitter for Android	Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police
6/4/2016 4:29:03	Twitter for Android	Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!
6/3/2016 13:13:50	Twitter for Android	In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday, she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!
6/3/2016 13:05:53	Twitter for Android	I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore. Small audience, low ratings! I hear Mika has gone wild with hate. Joe is Joe. They lost their way!
6/3/2016 12:43:51	Twitter for Android	Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside, small group of thugs burned Am flag!
6/3/2016 12:37:03	Twitter for Android	Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!
6/2/2016 22:16:50	Twitter for Android	A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare. I told you so, there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!
6/2/2016 19:18:14	Twitter for Android	Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!
6/2/2016 19:15:33	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!
6/2/2016 17:06:29	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.
6/2/2016 17:02:38	Twitter for Android	After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?), so much interest in it! I will be pres.
6/2/2016 16:54:21	Twitter for Android	Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego, I have thousands of great reviews &amp; will win case!
6/2/2016 16:48:50	Twitter for Android	With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience, she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.
6/2/2016 16:31:52	Twitter for Android	Wow, USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins, 38 losses. Isn't that what you want for your president?
6/2/2016 15:57:14	Twitter for Android	Do you ever notice that @CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign P
6/2/2016 15:10:22	Twitter for Android	Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!
6/2/2016 15:03:21	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!
6/1/2016 22:16:36	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!
6/1/2016 13:17:58	Twitter for Android	So I raised/gave $5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.
5/31/2016 16:57:17	Twitter for Android	So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.
5/31/2016 16:53:58	Twitter for Android	Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave!
5/31/2016 11:42:20	Twitter for Android	I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!
5/31/2016 10:48:49	Twitter for Android	So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today, Trump Tower!
5/30/2016 21:55:41	Twitter for Android	I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me.
5/30/2016 21:45:09	Twitter for Android	I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump
5/30/2016 20:15:04	Twitter for Android	I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!
5/30/2016 20:13:17	Twitter for Android	I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. Broke record
5/30/2016 11:26:47	Twitter for Android	Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
5/30/2016 11:05:34	Twitter for Android	The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!
5/30/2016 11:00:47	Twitter for Android	In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!
5/30/2016 10:41:49	Twitter for Android	Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
5/29/2016 22:58:27	Twitter for Android	The Republican Party has to be smart &amp; strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
5/29/2016 16:45:44	Twitter for Android	Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!

5/28/2016 14:47:16	Twitter for Android	I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
5/28/2016 13:47:10	Twitter for Android	The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH
5/27/2016 23:19:20	Twitter for Android	I am on @oreillyfactor tonight, a big special. @FoxNews  at 8:00 P.M. ENJOY!
5/27/2016 2:09:03	Twitter for Android	Poll data shows that @marcorubio does by far the best in holding onto his Senate seat in Florida. Important to keep the MAJORITY. Run Marco!
5/26/2016 13:18:27	Twitter for Android	The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster. Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W.H.
5/25/2016 13:39:38	Twitter for Android	The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!
5/25/2016 13:14:58	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it
5/25/2016 12:31:56	Twitter for Android	Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk, no action!
5/25/2016 12:17:40	Twitter for Android	@elizabethforma  Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes known as Pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!
5/25/2016 5:37:29	Twitter for Android	@elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native American, is a lowlife!
5/25/2016 5:12:44	Twitter for Android	Great rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.
5/24/2016 11:42:35	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
5/24/2016 10:41:44	Twitter for Android	I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
5/24/2016 2:50:48	Twitter for Android	Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
5/24/2016 2:46:08	Twitter for Android	Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
5/24/2016 2:38:48	Twitter for Android	While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 &amp; 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice!
5/23/2016 23:42:39	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
5/23/2016 17:15:20	Twitter Web Client	Obama’s VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measurewait times. Hillary says VA problems are not ‘widespread.’ I will take care ofour vets!
5/23/2016 13:46:57	Twitter for Android	In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
5/22/2016 20:44:48	Twitter for Android	The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!
5/22/2016 20:32:33	Twitter for Android	Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!
5/22/2016 12:47:48	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!
5/22/2016 3:55:39	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!
5/21/2016 12:49:59	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!
5/21/2016 10:56:20	Twitter for Android	While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster!
5/21/2016 1:56:44	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!
5/21/2016 1:51:57	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
5/21/2016 0:44:43	Twitter for Android	Thank you @TheTodaysGolfer for the wonderful statement that "the new par 3 9th hole @Trump Turnberry could be the most dramatic in Britain."
5/20/2016 23:36:17	Twitter for Android	@montgomeriefdn  Colin, great to have you at Trump Turnberry. So proud of you and your GREAT playing! You made winning MAJORS look easy!
5/20/2016 10:26:20	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!
5/20/2016 10:08:49	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!
5/20/2016 9:58:47	Twitter for Android	Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!
5/20/2016 9:47:09	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!
5/20/2016 9:40:37	Twitter for Android	I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!
5/19/2016 17:29:36	Twitter Web Client	How quality a woman is Rowanne Brewer Lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud?  Thank you Rowanne.
5/19/2016 10:27:48	Twitter for Android	Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!
5/19/2016 2:52:29	Twitter for Android	My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!
5/19/2016 1:54:08	Twitter for Android	Some low-life journalist claims that I "made a pass" at her 29 years ago. Never happened! Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!
5/18/2016 16:39:07	Twitter Web Client	Why did Clinton supporter @AlisonForKY declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race?
5/18/2016 11:20:19	Twitter for Android	Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!
5/18/2016 4:22:01	Twitter for Android	Paul Begala, the dopey @CNN flunky and head of the Pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC, has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.
5/18/2016 3:24:48	Twitter for Android	Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT, we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! Thank you.
5/18/2016 2:38:07	Twitter for Android	Michael Barbaro, the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women, has in past tweeted badly about me. He should resign
5/18/2016 1:53:58	Twitter for Android	I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged, e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!
5/18/2016 1:49:32	Twitter for Android	I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters. 7 to 1 - Don't watch CNN!
5/18/2016 0:57:16	Twitter for Android	Will go back on for a final question now!
5/18/2016 0:53:14	Twitter for Android	I like Michael Douglas!
5/17/2016 23:49:47	Twitter for Android	I will be live tweeting @megynkelly Show in 10 minutes. Should be interesting. Will be on Fox Network! ENJOY!
5/17/2016 23:42:33	Twitter for Android	Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. Apologize?
5/17/2016 23:37:06	Twitter for Android	Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky, she should drop out of race. System rigged!
5/17/2016 15:25:41	Twitter Web Client	I look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight, 8 PM ET. It will be interesting to see how she treats me—I think she will be very fair.
5/17/2016 14:21:55	Twitter for Android	How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA, the worst economic deal in U.S. history?
5/17/2016 14:17:07	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so, he should run,not her.Will he bring the "energizer" to D.C.?
5/17/2016 12:31:53	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!
5/17/2016 11:58:10	Twitter for Android	Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history
5/17/2016 11:52:00	Twitter for Android	Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
5/17/2016 11:46:22	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China
5/17/2016 11:37:03	Twitter for Android	The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. "You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China, NOT WOMEN!
5/17/2016 11:29:09	Twitter for Android	Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?
5/17/2016 4:02:45	Twitter for Android	What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no.
5/17/2016 3:46:35	Twitter for Android	I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!
5/17/2016 1:08:17	Twitter for Android	In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!
5/16/2016 22:15:52	Twitter Web Client	The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond.
5/16/2016 22:14:19	Twitter Web Client	Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. That’s because there were so many positive statements.
5/16/2016 22:13:20	Twitter Web Client	No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious &amp; libelous story they did on me.
5/16/2016 22:12:53	Twitter Web Client	The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.
5/16/2016 15:25:02	Twitter Web Client	With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud!
5/16/2016 13:24:21	Twitter for Android	A political commentator for @cnn, which I no longer watch, said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries." I set all-time record!
5/16/2016 13:12:38	Twitter Web Client	Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied
5/16/2016 13:09:26	Twitter Web Client	The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!
5/16/2016 11:00:58	Twitter for Android	That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!
5/16/2016 10:00:52	Twitter for Android	Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie, run.
5/16/2016 1:25:54	Twitter for Android	The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.
5/15/2016 19:26:45	Twitter for Android	The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting, and plenty of it - but we will prevail!
5/15/2016 19:11:30	Twitter for Android	Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!
5/15/2016 19:06:18	Twitter for Android	Wow, I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that!
5/15/2016 11:32:14	Twitter for Android	Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!
5/15/2016 11:13:17	Twitter for Android	Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use
5/15/2016 10:55:39	Twitter for Android	The failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women, they found nothing. A joke!
5/15/2016 10:49:31	Twitter for Android	Thank you for the nice words this morning @KellyRiddell. Well delivered and totally logical! @CNN   @FoxNews
5/14/2016 15:16:06	Twitter for Android	Wow, @CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings - bad television!
5/14/2016 1:03:02	Twitter for Android	If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie, how is she going to take on China, Russia, ISIS and all of the others?
5/13/2016 18:40:19	Twitter Web Client	.@thehill  Your story about me &amp; the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect—it is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!
5/13/2016 2:32:52	Twitter for Android	Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more!
5/11/2016 21:07:02	Twitter Web Client	If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, we’d have no jobs in America—she doesn’t have a clue.
5/11/2016 20:51:20	Twitter for Android	In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election!
5/11/2016 20:41:51	Twitter Web Client	Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump &amp; gets nothing done in Senate?
5/11/2016 20:22:28	Twitter Web Client	Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase!
5/11/2016 20:03:35	Twitter Web Client	Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn’t care less about the American worker…does nothing to help!
5/11/2016 19:37:51	Twitter Web Client	Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…”
5/11/2016 19:18:11	Twitter Web Client	If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose!
5/11/2016 17:12:06	Twitter Web Client	Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.
5/11/2016 14:18:21	Twitter Web Client	Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!
5/11/2016 10:26:37	Twitter for Android	I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!
5/11/2016 10:22:54	Twitter for Android	Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose!
5/10/2016 19:31:30	Twitter Web Client	The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me &amp; I can’t tell the truth about her husband? Don’t feel sorry for crooked Hillary!
5/10/2016 17:13:49	Twitter Web Client	It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!
5/10/2016 16:18:41	Twitter Web Client	I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan &amp; the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together, we will beat the Dems at all levels!
5/10/2016 14:03:51	Twitter for Android	It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.
5/10/2016 13:57:33	Twitter for Android	It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me, not Crooked Hillary! @marthamaccallum
5/10/2016 12:57:08	Twitter for Android	Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!
5/10/2016 11:31:57	Twitter for Android	. #RepMikeKelly  Great job on @foxandfriends this morning. Thank you for the nice words!
5/10/2016 10:27:51	Twitter for Android	Get out and vote Nebraska, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
5/10/2016 10:20:40	Twitter for Android	Get out and vote West Virginia, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
5/9/2016 17:21:21	Twitter Web Client	I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!
5/9/2016 16:59:00	Twitter Web Client	I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!
5/9/2016 16:57:46	Twitter Web Client	If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!
5/9/2016 16:56:36	Twitter Web Client	Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beat—she had one!
5/9/2016 11:33:14	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBizAlert  at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!
5/9/2016 10:39:12	Twitter for Android	Wow, I hear @Morning_Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore.They misrepresent my positions!
5/9/2016 10:27:02	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @CNN at 7:00 A.M.
5/9/2016 10:05:49	Twitter for Android	.@drmoore  Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for. A nasty guy with no heart!
5/7/2016 17:46:46	Twitter for Android	Remember when the two failed presidential candidates, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush, signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal, no honor!
5/7/2016 15:53:38	Twitter for Android	I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump! Thank you.
5/7/2016 15:47:00	Twitter for Android	I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S., and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Crooked Hillary has no clue! @Teamsters
5/6/2016 16:08:23	Twitter Web Client	Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
5/6/2016 12:38:38	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!
5/6/2016 12:08:37	Twitter for Android	Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!
5/6/2016 10:26:43	Twitter for Android	So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
5/6/2016 10:19:08	Twitter for Android	Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen." Thank you Rick!
5/6/2016 10:14:56	Twitter for Android	Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!
5/5/2016 19:30:32	Twitter Web Client	Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates &amp; otherwise. He should show them, &amp; run as an Independent.
5/5/2016 18:37:47	Twitter Web Client	I will be interviewed by @BretBaier @SpecialReport at 6pm ET tonight @FoxNews
5/5/2016 14:29:40	Twitter Web Client	Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.
5/4/2016 10:12:54	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!
5/4/2016 10:09:36	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @TODAYshow and Good Morning America at 7:00 A.M.
5/4/2016 10:04:23	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 6:15 A.M. Enjoy!
5/4/2016 9:44:28	Twitter for Android	I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!
5/4/2016 9:25:10	Twitter for Android	What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!
5/4/2016 4:00:46	Twitter for Android	.@oreillyfactor  Please correct, I WON Virginia!
5/3/2016 23:38:34	Twitter for Android	Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!
5/3/2016 23:08:44	Twitter for Android	Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time &amp; money
5/3/2016 23:02:55	Twitter for Android	Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!
5/2/2016 14:06:30	Twitter for Android	Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!
5/2/2016 11:21:02	Twitter for Android	Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.
5/2/2016 11:12:40	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation." Actually, she has done poorly with such men!
5/2/2016 10:42:59	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @CNN  @NewDay  at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!
5/1/2016 3:10:35	Twitter for Android	I will be in Indiana on Sunday and Monday at four MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rallies. See you there!
4/30/2016 23:33:19	Twitter for Android	Thank you @MikeOzanian for the nice comments on @FoxNews today. Great job!
4/30/2016 17:21:35	Twitter for Android	The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
4/30/2016 13:31:13	Twitter for Android	The "protesters" in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!
4/30/2016 3:07:59	Twitter for Android	.@AC360  Anderson, so amazing. Your mother is, and always has been, an incredible woman!
4/29/2016 18:28:05	Twitter for Android	We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!
4/29/2016 13:46:49	Twitter for Android	Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!
4/29/2016 11:22:04	Twitter for Android	Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!
4/28/2016 13:25:54	Twitter for Android	So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!
4/28/2016 12:14:37	Twitter for Android	I will be in Evansville, Indiana, with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there!
4/28/2016 11:31:48	Twitter for Android	Lyin' Ted Cruz, who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory, has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort
4/28/2016 10:47:06	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. this morning. Enjoy!
4/28/2016 10:41:35	Twitter for Android	Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!
4/28/2016 3:49:52	Twitter for Android	Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, Bobby Knight, has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!
4/28/2016 3:17:17	Twitter for Android	I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean, not bad!
4/26/2016 17:43:15	Twitter Web Client	How bad is the New York Times—the most inaccurate coverage constantly. Always trying to belittle. Paper has lost its way!
4/26/2016 16:07:35	Twitter Web Client	Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates &amp; otherwise. He should show them, and run as an Independent!
4/26/2016 10:42:39	Twitter for Android	The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!
4/25/2016 16:16:27	Twitter Web Client	On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
4/25/2016 16:15:58	Twitter Web Client	Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
4/25/2016 11:59:06	Twitter for Android	Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
4/25/2016 11:54:21	Twitter for Android	Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
4/25/2016 3:49:17	Twitter for Android	Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
4/25/2016 3:39:58	Twitter for Android	Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
4/25/2016 1:27:12	Twitter for Android	I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!
4/24/2016 14:01:37	Twitter for Android	I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!
4/24/2016 13:58:53	Twitter for Android	.@AndreBauer  Great job and advice on @CNN  @jaketapper  Thank you!
4/24/2016 2:01:25	Twitter for Android	.@Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight. Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct!
4/24/2016 1:48:17	Twitter for Android	As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!
4/24/2016 1:41:57	Twitter for Android	I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!
4/24/2016 0:55:43	Twitter for Android	Congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @AP today. Amazing job!
4/23/2016 12:37:16	Twitter for Android	Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut, another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. I will stop this fast!
4/21/2016 21:47:21	Twitter for Android	Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
4/21/2016 10:22:03	Twitter for Android	Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!
4/21/2016 10:14:48	Twitter for Android	I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M.
4/20/2016 12:42:59	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!
4/20/2016 3:22:19	Twitter for Android	Thank you New York, I will never forget!
4/20/2016 0:54:52	Twitter for Android	.@CNN is so negative it is impossible to watch. Terrible panel, angry haters. Bill O  @oreillyfactor said such an amazing thing about me!
4/19/2016 12:13:34	Twitter for Android	A big day for New York and for our COUNTRY! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
4/19/2016 11:01:10	Twitter for Android	I am on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. ENJOY!
4/18/2016 21:54:52	Twitter Web Client	Lyin’ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!
4/18/2016 11:02:24	Twitter for Android	Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him
4/18/2016 10:58:00	Twitter for Android	Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him &amp; K
4/16/2016 12:00:26	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 9:00 A.M. I will be talking about the rigged and boss controlled Republican primaries!
4/14/2016 4:11:46	Twitter for Android	Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon! Don't let the bosses take your vote!
4/14/2016 3:53:59	Twitter for Android	The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters
4/14/2016 3:46:29	Twitter for Android	Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!
4/13/2016 3:53:39	Twitter for Android	Great to be on @andersoncooper tonight with my wonderful family. Will be rebroadcast at 12:00 A.M.  (EASTERN).
4/11/2016 10:45:01	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. Enjoy!
4/11/2016 0:50:56	Twitter for Android	The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!
4/11/2016 0:28:54	Twitter for Android	How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!
4/10/2016 13:47:57	Twitter for Android	I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!
4/10/2016 13:40:23	Twitter for Android	The @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately. I want other nations to pay the U.S. for our defense of them. We are the suckers-no more!
4/9/2016 11:22:32	Twitter for Android	Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!
4/9/2016 3:07:00	Twitter for Android	Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else, me, still must fight
4/8/2016 12:03:23	Twitter for Android	So great to be in New York. Catching up on many things (remember, I am still running a major business while I campaign) and loving it!
4/6/2016 16:40:53	Twitter Web Client	It is so great to be back home! Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage, Long Island!
4/2/2016 11:15:20	Twitter for Android	Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if I win, all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!
4/2/2016 2:21:56	Twitter for Android	I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs, trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!
4/2/2016 2:09:29	Twitter for Android	If @megynkelly stopped covering me on her show, her ratings would drop like a rock! My h to h interview with @AC360 beat her by millions!
4/2/2016 1:44:00	Twitter for Android	Is it possible for @megynkelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show. She totally misrepresents my words and positions! BAD.
4/1/2016 21:52:14	Twitter Web Client	Can you believe that Ted Cruz, who has been killing our country on trade for so long, just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade?
4/1/2016 14:25:17	Twitter Web Client	For the 1st time in American history, America’s 16,500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement—me! Thank you.
4/1/2016 14:24:46	Twitter Web Client	The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical &amp; economic threat facing the American people!
4/1/2016 4:29:49	Twitter for Android	The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again!
4/1/2016 4:23:25	Twitter for Android	The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group!
3/29/2016 16:44:36	Twitter for Android	Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
3/29/2016 16:41:33	Twitter for Android	Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
3/29/2016 14:45:37	Twitter for Android	How come the @TODAYshow &amp; @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?
3/29/2016 14:16:19	Twitter for Android	I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
3/29/2016 13:34:36	Twitter for Android	Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!
3/29/2016 1:07:23	Twitter for Android	We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN &amp; MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
3/29/2016 1:04:06	Twitter for Android	Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs &amp; illegal imm!
3/29/2016 0:57:35	Twitter for Android	Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak &amp; losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates
3/28/2016 23:13:27	Twitter for Android	After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me!
3/28/2016 22:34:11	Twitter for Android	Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!
3/28/2016 22:18:21	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must!
3/28/2016 17:25:23	Twitter for Android	A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn!

3/28/2016 1:17:57	Twitter for Android	The United States cannot continue to make such bad, one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!
3/27/2016 21:11:43	Twitter for Android	Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming
3/27/2016 20:55:59	Twitter for Android	Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!

3/27/2016 14:23:51	Twitter for Android	My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now, finally, receiving plaudits!
3/27/2016 14:14:05	Twitter for Android	Wow, sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others
3/27/2016 13:02:06	Twitter for Android	I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning. Enjoy!
3/26/2016 20:16:02	Twitter for Android	Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others!
3/26/2016 20:12:01	Twitter for Android	Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls, they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.
3/26/2016 19:27:56	Twitter for Android	Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S., jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs
3/26/2016 19:20:33	Twitter for Android	Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!
3/26/2016 19:13:48	Twitter for Android	Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!
3/26/2016 19:01:42	Twitter for Android	The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!
3/26/2016 15:19:31	Twitter for Android	The media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
3/26/2016 2:43:18	Twitter for Android	Top suspect in Paris massacre, Salah Abdeslam, who also knew of the Brussels attack, is no longer talking. Weak leaders, ridiculous laws!
3/24/2016 22:42:27	Twitter for Android	Wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?
3/24/2016 22:31:17	Twitter for Android	I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted!
3/24/2016 21:48:17	Twitter for Android	Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story!
3/24/2016 15:55:32	Twitter for Android	Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!
3/24/2016 15:52:11	Twitter for Android	Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also, many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!
3/24/2016 15:39:16	Twitter for Android	Explain how the women on The View, which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left, ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time
3/24/2016 15:33:34	Twitter for Android	.@TheView T.V. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM "NO"
3/24/2016 14:46:29	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!
3/24/2016 14:38:13	Twitter for Android	It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO!
3/24/2016 14:17:57	Twitter for Android	Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!
3/24/2016 14:07:07	Twitter for Android	.@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS, do nothing!
3/24/2016 14:02:27	Twitter for Android	It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run!
3/24/2016 11:59:06	Twitter for Android	We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now!
3/24/2016 11:47:26	Twitter for Android	N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!
3/23/2016 23:25:00	Twitter for Android	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
3/23/2016 21:44:44	Twitter for Android	I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!
3/23/2016 21:12:54	Twitter for Android	While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
3/23/2016 20:02:29	Twitter for Android	I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!
3/23/2016 19:54:59	Twitter Web Client	I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I’m the only one that was right from the beginning, &amp; now Lyin’ Ted &amp; others are copying me.
3/23/2016 19:53:39	Twitter Web Client	Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
3/23/2016 19:49:49	Twitter Web Client	Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin’ Ted Cruz. Honestly, I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
3/23/2016 19:45:44	Twitter Web Client	Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician.
3/23/2016 14:22:51	Twitter for Android	Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
3/23/2016 4:04:34	Twitter for Android	Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!
3/23/2016 3:43:50	Twitter for Android	Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget!
3/23/2016 2:59:29	Twitter for Android	Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!
3/23/2016 1:53:05	Twitter for Android	Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!
3/22/2016 19:17:41	Twitter for Android	Obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.
3/22/2016 15:32:36	Twitter Web Client	I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it’s not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!
3/22/2016 14:54:32	Twitter for Android	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
3/22/2016 14:53:34	Twitter for Android	President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!
3/20/2016 20:41:03	Twitter for Android	Wow, President Obama just landed in Cuba, a big deal, and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect
3/20/2016 19:45:33	Twitter for Android	Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there!
3/20/2016 19:10:55	Twitter for Android	So the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly, is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but I can't fight back? Wrong!
3/20/2016 18:52:32	Twitter for Android	The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters!
3/20/2016 16:13:50	Twitter for Android	Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES,  are never blamed by media? SAD!
3/20/2016 11:55:27	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed on @ThisWeekABC this morning. Enjoy!
3/20/2016 5:05:04	Twitter for Android	The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.
3/19/2016 15:16:55	Twitter for Android	If crazy @megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show, her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways!
3/19/2016 15:14:32	Twitter for Android	Crazy @megynkelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me!
3/18/2016 20:18:14	Twitter for Android	Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!
3/18/2016 20:07:50	Twitter for Android	Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary
3/18/2016 19:57:35	Twitter for Android	Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!
3/18/2016 19:44:17	Twitter for Android	With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?
3/18/2016 19:08:05	Twitter Web Client	.@EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedStateand now he is the one leading opposition against me.
3/18/2016 19:03:48	Twitter Web Client	Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz – and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!
3/18/2016 16:42:29	Twitter for Android	Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!
3/18/2016 0:37:17	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!
3/17/2016 20:30:08	Twitter for Android	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
3/17/2016 16:58:04	Twitter Web Client	Highly overrated &amp; crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!
3/17/2016 16:54:21	Twitter Web Client	Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!
3/17/2016 13:22:07	Twitter for Android	Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc., all 11 of them!
3/17/2016 13:11:31	Twitter for Android	.@WSJ is bad at math. The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me!
3/17/2016 13:08:55	Twitter for Android	.@WSJ Editorial says "Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.Trump's is 7,533,692"-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize
3/17/2016 12:28:17	Twitter for Android	The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
3/17/2016 12:19:55	Twitter for Android	Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!
3/17/2016 10:40:53	Twitter for Android	Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating
3/17/2016 10:17:00	Twitter for Android	Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!
3/17/2016 10:09:00	Twitter for Android	Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad!
3/16/2016 21:26:40	Twitter Web Client	I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel. @oreillyfactor
3/16/2016 18:56:09	Twitter for Android	Wow, just won Missouri!

3/16/2016 17:13:17	Twitter Web Client	In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida &amp; I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$!
3/16/2016 17:04:49	Twitter Web Client	Yesterday was amazing—5 victories.  Lyin’ Ted Cruzhad zero. Things are going very well!
3/16/2016 13:37:39	Twitter for Android	.@RepTomMarino  Great job on television this morning. Glad to have you on my side!
3/16/2016 0:09:08	Twitter for Android	Watching other networks and local news. Really good night! Crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable.
3/16/2016 0:05:04	Twitter for Android	Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people, big &amp; over!
3/15/2016 23:06:59	Twitter for Android	Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!
3/15/2016 19:11:12	Twitter for Android	A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.
3/15/2016 16:16:16	Twitter for Android	I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.
3/15/2016 16:03:57	Twitter for Android	In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
3/15/2016 15:03:34	Twitter for Android	Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
3/15/2016 14:53:41	Twitter for Android	Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.
3/15/2016 13:37:24	Twitter for Android	North Carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400,000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN, WE WILL BRING BACK!
3/15/2016 11:31:46	Twitter for Android	Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).
3/15/2016 10:39:06	Twitter for Android	Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
3/15/2016 10:25:53	Twitter for Android	I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
3/15/2016 4:21:20	Twitter for Android	Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
3/15/2016 4:10:00	Twitter for Android	Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!
3/13/2016 18:53:07	Twitter for Android	The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!
3/13/2016 14:49:44	Twitter for Android	Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the @GolfChannel
3/13/2016 11:58:17	Twitter for Android	Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!
3/13/2016 11:48:44	Twitter for Android	Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!
3/12/2016 22:47:59	Twitter for Android	Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words, education of your children from D.C. No way
3/12/2016 18:24:56	Twitter for Android	The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!
3/12/2016 14:55:15	Twitter for Android	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
3/12/2016 14:54:27	Twitter for Android	On my way to Dayton, Ohio. Will be there soon!
3/12/2016 14:35:09	Twitter for Android	The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!
3/12/2016 14:17:41	Twitter for Android	Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!
3/12/2016 13:35:19	Twitter for Android	Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!
3/12/2016 11:44:54	Twitter for Android	The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!
3/11/2016 20:33:56	Twitter for Android	Rumor has it that @politico is going out of business. Losing too much money. Great news! Likewise, dopey Mort Zuckerman's @NYDailyNews
3/10/2016 21:41:18	Twitter for Android	Wow, you are all correct about @FoxNews - totally biased and disgusting reporting.
3/8/2016 23:58:02	Twitter for Android	Word is I am doing very well in Michigan and Mississippi! Wow, and with all that money spent against me! Will be going to Trump Jupiter now!
3/8/2016 23:53:48	Twitter for Android	I hear @NBCNews / @WSJ came out with another one of their phony polls. While I am leading, they are totally discredited after last S.C. poll
3/8/2016 20:57:48	Twitter for Android	The negative television commercials about me, paid for by the politicians bosses, are a total #Mediafraud. When you watch, remember!
3/8/2016 17:36:00	Twitter for Android	Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it. Lindsey Graham ran for president, got ZERO, and quit! Why are they now spokesmen against me? Sad!
3/8/2016 16:21:11	Twitter for Android	Remember, I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign. All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests!
3/8/2016 16:12:12	Twitter for Android	Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience, work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE!
3/8/2016 15:23:49	Twitter for Android	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
3/7/2016 21:23:58	Twitter for Android	It was great being in Michigan. Remember, I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!
3/7/2016 16:50:14	Twitter for Android	Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people!
3/7/2016 15:23:00	Twitter for Android	Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd, will be fun!
3/7/2016 13:55:14	Twitter for Android	Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish!
3/7/2016 13:10:22	Twitter for Android	I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate, he is scamming Florida
3/7/2016 13:03:16	Twitter for Android	We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, who could not stop Obama (twice), ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads!
3/7/2016 12:03:59	Twitter for Android	Lindsey Graham is all over T.V., much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty, angry, jealous  failures have ZERO credibility!
3/7/2016 11:48:39	Twitter for Android	Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run, brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!
3/7/2016 2:58:38	Twitter for Android	How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook &amp; Twitter. Watch!
3/7/2016 2:54:29	Twitter for Android	All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, the bandits that tell your pols what to do
3/6/2016 18:15:29	Twitter for Android	I am at Trump National Doral-best resort in U.S. Rory and Adam Scott are doing great! Watch on NBC at 3:00 P.M.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

3/6/2016 5:40:37	Twitter for Android	.@FoxNews is devastated that lightweight Senator Marco Rubio got trounced tonight and is the big loser. I won the two big states, great!

3/3/2016 11:59:47	Twitter for Android	Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?
3/3/2016 11:47:21	Twitter for Android	I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney, who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of "Trump"
3/3/2016 11:40:17	Twitter for Android	Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who, as a Senator, never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!
3/3/2016 11:30:35	Twitter for Android	I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!
3/3/2016 11:22:32	Twitter for Android	Failed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win!
3/3/2016 3:33:07	Twitter for Android	Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!
3/3/2016 3:18:30	Twitter for Android	Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio &amp; Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS
3/3/2016 3:05:35	Twitter for Android	Because of me, the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters, a record. If they are not careful, they will all leave. Sad!
3/2/2016 21:50:30	Twitter for Android	Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger, stronger party!
3/2/2016 18:18:37	Twitter for Android	Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia, where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!
3/2/2016 18:11:23	Twitter for Android	Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam, his house sale &amp; his no show voting!
3/2/2016 17:53:38	Twitter for Android	The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.
3/1/2016 11:15:32	Twitter for Android	Got the endorsement of Brian France and @NASCAR yesterday in Georgia. Also, many of the sports great drivers. Thank you Nascar and Georgia!
2/29/2016 12:36:08	Twitter for Android	My sons, Don and Eric, are on @foxandfriends now 7:35. Great kids, enjoy!
2/28/2016 17:53:29	Twitter for Android	Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic!
2/28/2016 17:47:56	Twitter for Android	Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab!
2/28/2016 16:47:13	Twitter for Android	Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk, no action pol!
2/28/2016 16:07:48	Twitter for Android	Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!
2/28/2016 12:58:01	Twitter for Android	Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us!
2/28/2016 12:43:28	Twitter for Android	I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get.
2/28/2016 12:20:19	Twitter for Android	While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins, Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY
2/28/2016 12:10:36	Twitter for Android	The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump.I signed the pledge-careful
2/28/2016 11:28:47	Twitter for Android	While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil), word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio, the lightweight from Florida
2/27/2016 21:20:48	Twitter for Android	Just watched lightweight Marco Rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record. He is not as smart as Cruz, and may be an even bigger liar
2/27/2016 17:11:35	Twitter for Android	.#RogerStone was just banned by @CNN - their loss! Tough, loyal guy.
2/27/2016 16:08:40	Twitter for Android	I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!
2/27/2016 16:04:35	Twitter for Android	I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!
2/27/2016 15:49:52	Twitter for Android	Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!
2/27/2016 15:25:07	Twitter for Android	I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!
2/27/2016 15:20:33	Twitter for Android	Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem!
2/27/2016 15:12:47	Twitter for Android	I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?
2/27/2016 13:08:21	Twitter for Android	I will be on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. Will be talking about lightweight Marco Rubio and lying Ted Cruz!
2/26/2016 16:07:56	Twitter for Android	Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!
2/26/2016 14:49:40	Twitter for Android	Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!
2/26/2016 14:02:29	Twitter for Android	Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser!
2/26/2016 13:56:30	Twitter for Android	I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth, Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus!
2/25/2016 20:27:15	Twitter for Android	FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!
2/25/2016 16:05:01	Twitter Web Client	Why doesn’t @MittRomney just endorse @marcorubio already.Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too latenow!
2/25/2016 12:34:11	Twitter for Android	Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!
2/25/2016 1:08:05	Twitter for Android	.@RepChrisCollins  Chris, thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. I will not let you down! @CNN
2/24/2016 23:49:15	Twitter for Android	When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear, I will get most of his votes - no problem!
2/24/2016 23:45:06	Twitter for Android	Why would Texans vote for "liar" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada, lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently
2/24/2016 23:26:19	Twitter for Android	When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win!
2/24/2016 23:13:15	Twitter for Android	Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy
2/24/2016 21:36:35	Twitter for Android	The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out, I will pick up more.  Sad but true
2/24/2016 16:12:50	Twitter for Android	.@USATODAY Poll and @QuinnipiacPoll say that I beat both Hillary and Bernie, and I havn't even started on them yet!
2/24/2016 16:09:46	Twitter for Android	Big defeat last night in Nevada for Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. @KarlRove on @FoxNews is working hard to belittle my victory. Rove is sick!

2/23/2016 17:11:30	Twitter for Android	Unlike the other Republican candidates, I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing, in and out. I love &amp; invest in Nevada!
2/23/2016 15:47:08	Twitter for Android	I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers, way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.
2/23/2016 15:15:55	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out &amp; said no!
2/23/2016 15:07:26	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!
2/23/2016 14:40:53	Twitter for Android	Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.
2/23/2016 14:37:10	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.
2/23/2016 2:31:20	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz said on @oreillyfactor that illegals sent out of country by my administration would come right back as citizens. Another lie-crazy!
2/23/2016 2:27:20	Twitter for Android	A big fat hit job on @oreillyfactor tonight. A total waste of time to watch, boring and biased. @brithume said I would never run, a dope!
2/23/2016 2:19:01	Twitter for Android	Great Town Hall tonight at 10:00 P.M. (Eastern) conducted by @seanhannity on @FoxNews
2/23/2016 1:29:02	Twitter for Android	Just watched the very incompetent Mitt Romney Campaign Strategist, Stuart Stevens. Now I know why Mitt lost so badly. Stevens is a clown!
2/22/2016 21:11:17	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.
2/22/2016 21:06:25	Twitter for Android	Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
2/22/2016 20:55:16	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
2/22/2016 20:50:18	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
2/22/2016 20:44:02	Twitter for Android	Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!
2/22/2016 20:37:55	Twitter for Android	It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.
2/22/2016 16:12:21	Twitter for Android	Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!
2/22/2016 13:36:39	Twitter for Android	The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR, and Evangelicals do not like liars!
2/22/2016 12:48:30	Twitter for Android	I am in Las Vegas, at the best hotel (by far), Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!
2/22/2016 12:22:38	Twitter for Android	A number of months ago, I was not expected to win South Carolina,Ted Cruz was, and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category. WIN!
2/21/2016 11:52:51	Twitter for Android	The failing @WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board. Seldom has a paper been so wrong.Totally biased!
2/21/2016 11:36:28	Twitter for Android	I will be live on all of the major morning talk shows. Enjoy!
2/21/2016 11:09:50	Twitter for Android	Thank you @SarahPalinUSA for your amazing help and support. Big win, leaving now for Atlanta and Nevada.The people of South Carolina got it!
2/21/2016 3:01:10	Twitter for Android	What a great night. Thank you South Carolina, a special place with truly amazing people! LOVE
2/21/2016 0:05:57	Twitter for Android	People (pundits) gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE)
2/20/2016 17:39:24	Twitter for Android	South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today), and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
2/20/2016 17:02:44	Twitter for Android	Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it
2/20/2016 16:42:11	Twitter for Android	I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!
2/20/2016 15:31:23	Twitter for Android	I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates!

2/19/2016 21:33:04	Twitter Web Client	Hopefully others will follow suit. Our country needs &amp; should demand security. It is time to get tough &amp; be smart!
2/19/2016 21:32:43	Twitter Web Client	I use both iPhone &amp; Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info.
2/18/2016 14:11:18	Twitter for Android	I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!
2/18/2016 14:05:38	Twitter for Android	.@FoxNews is changing their  theme from "fair and balanced" to "unfair and unbalanced." But dying @WSJ is worse.Their phony poll is a  joke!
2/18/2016 12:26:46	Twitter for Android	New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!
2/18/2016 11:25:40	Twitter for Android	I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
2/18/2016 10:53:34	Twitter for Android	The just out USA Today National Poll, where I lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, I beat both Hillary and Bernie.
2/18/2016 10:44:28	Twitter for Android	Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.
2/17/2016 14:49:02	Twitter for Android	.@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!
2/17/2016 11:08:15	Twitter for Android	Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!
2/17/2016 3:58:40	Twitter for Android	Why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me, almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!
2/17/2016 3:44:39	Twitter for Android	Thank you  @kayleighmcenany for your nice words - great knowledge and style! We are doing really well in South Carolina. @CNN @donlemon
2/17/2016 3:12:52	Twitter for Android	.@brithume thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race, someone will pick up ALL of that vote. The fact is I will get much of it!
2/17/2016 3:04:22	Twitter for Android	Explain to @brithume and @megynkelly, who know nothing, that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other R can!
2/16/2016 11:22:02	Twitter for Android	New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big, Cruz, Rubio and Bush down. The debate results, even with a stacked RNC audience, were wonderful!
2/16/2016 10:52:09	Twitter for Android	Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina. Great people and spirit. Today will be more of the same.
2/15/2016 14:04:31	Twitter for Android	Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!
2/15/2016 13:55:08	Twitter for Android	I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
2/15/2016 12:24:00	Twitter for Android	Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada
2/15/2016 11:05:15	Twitter for Android	Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother!
2/14/2016 22:02:19	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!
2/14/2016 21:10:20	Twitter for Android	Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!
2/14/2016 21:07:04	Twitter for Android	Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists &amp; special interests - the bosses!
2/14/2016 20:55:59	Twitter for Android	Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors &amp; special ints
2/14/2016 12:56:20	Twitter for Android	Even though every poll, Time, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate by a lot, @FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke!
2/13/2016 16:43:32	Twitter for Android	A very big thank you to Bill Donohue, head of The Catholic League, for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax! Great insight

2/12/2016 21:54:11	Twitter for Android	Millions of $'s of false ads,  paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz  and sleepy @JebBush, are now running in S.C.
2/12/2016 20:30:07	Twitter for Android	Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time, he is out!
2/12/2016 18:59:38	Twitter Web Client	Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!
2/12/2016 16:19:14	Twitter Web Client	The failing @NYDailyNews, destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman, is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead!
2/11/2016 20:39:33	Twitter for Android	We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching!
2/11/2016 19:45:59	Twitter for Android	Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!
2/11/2016 16:51:04	Twitter for Android	He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
2/11/2016 16:14:10	Twitter for Android	Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT
2/11/2016 15:40:04	Twitter for Android	.@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize!
2/11/2016 15:11:56	Twitter for Android	Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!
2/11/2016 14:13:09	Twitter for Android	There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!
2/10/2016 13:37:25	Twitter for Android	Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.
2/9/2016 16:46:17	Twitter for Android	New Hampshire vote today -  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

2/9/2016 12:23:37	Twitter for Android	The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!
2/9/2016 12:16:37	Twitter for Android	No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
2/9/2016 12:08:19	Twitter for Android	I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!
2/9/2016 12:00:30	Twitter for Android	Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!
2/8/2016 12:20:11	Twitter for Android	Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!
2/8/2016 12:01:01	Twitter for Android	My two wonderful sons, Don and Eric, will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! Enjoy.
2/8/2016 2:03:31	Twitter for Android	So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
2/6/2016 21:40:04	Twitter for Android	I love New Hampshire - will be an exciting evening!
2/6/2016 14:37:35	Twitter for Android	Wow, Jeb Bush, whose campaign is a total disaster, had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me. Not nice!
2/5/2016 20:36:19	Twitter Web Client	Such great support in New Hampshire. So many people are working so hard to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
2/5/2016 20:29:19	Twitter Web Client	I very much look forward to tomorrow’s debate in New Hampshire—so many things to say, so much at stake. It will be an incredible evening!
2/5/2016 16:50:49	Twitter Web Client	Big storm in New Hampshire. Moved my event to Monday. Will be there next four days.
2/5/2016 1:03:23	Twitter for Android	Watch @AC360 on NOW! @CNN
2/4/2016 3:11:26	Twitter for Android	Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!
2/3/2016 19:09:38	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews
2/3/2016 14:28:59	Twitter for Android	Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
2/3/2016 14:21:03	Twitter for Android	And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
2/3/2016 14:10:53	Twitter for Android	The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
2/3/2016 14:07:25	Twitter for Android	Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
2/3/2016 13:56:48	Twitter for Android	During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
2/3/2016 13:47:33	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
2/3/2016 5:12:23	Twitter for Android	Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN
2/2/2016 20:02:48	Twitter Web Client	Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!
2/2/2016 19:41:15	Twitter Web Client	@restorereality  Iowa is meaningless...keep pushing forward, run the table in NH SC NV and Super Tuesday. America needs you! #TrumpTrain
2/2/2016 19:15:55	Twitter Web Client	.@Morning_Joe  @mikebarnicle on @realDonaldTrump: He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro"
2/2/2016 16:39:05	Twitter for Android	I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it!
2/2/2016 16:34:02	Twitter for Android	I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd
2/2/2016 16:29:05	Twitter for Android	The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
2/2/2016 16:14:24	Twitter for Android	Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz &amp; Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor
2/2/2016 16:03:21	Twitter for Android	My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice
2/1/2016 13:25:20	Twitter for Android	It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1/31/2016 14:47:07	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning. Enjoy!
1/31/2016 14:44:00	Twitter for Android	I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos  this morning. ENJOY!
1/31/2016 14:40:25	Twitter for Android	If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000.
1/31/2016 14:32:03	Twitter for Android	By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS.
1/31/2016 14:22:35	Twitter for Android	Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal &amp; replace. He lies!
1/31/2016 13:16:37	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam!
1/31/2016 13:06:25	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!
1/31/2016 12:49:34	Twitter for Android	I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!
1/31/2016 12:42:28	Twitter for Android	.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends
1/31/2016 12:36:39	Twitter for Android	.@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends
1/31/2016 12:31:03	Twitter for Android	.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!
1/31/2016 12:22:48	Twitter for Android	The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!
1/30/2016 12:38:44	Twitter for Android	I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally, after all these years of watching stupidity, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1/30/2016 3:52:49	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material!
1/30/2016 1:41:51	Twitter for Android	.@oreillyfactor  The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights, as I will do for the U.S. Also got $6,000,000 for our VETS!
1/30/2016 1:31:51	Twitter for Android	.@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS.
1/30/2016 1:25:17	Twitter for Android	Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!
1/30/2016 1:15:43	Twitter for Android	.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta
1/30/2016 1:10:56	Twitter for Android	The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.
1/29/2016 23:51:34	Twitter for Android	The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?
1/29/2016 13:45:39	Twitter for Android	Getting ready to take off for Nashua, New Hampshire. Big crowd, will be there soon. Fun!
1/29/2016 13:42:58	Twitter for Android	Iowa was amazing last night. The event could not have worked out better. We raised $6,000,000 for our great vets. They were so happy &amp; proud
1/28/2016 19:52:03	Twitter Web Client	I hear that @SenTedCruz’s $$ man, Robert Mercer, a good man, is very angry because Cruz lied to him about liquidating his (Ted’s) holdings.?
1/28/2016 13:20:01	Twitter for Android	The "debate" tonight will be a total disaster - low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. I hate to see this.
1/28/2016 11:56:16	Twitter for Android	Wow, two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event tonight at Drake University.
1/27/2016 22:00:07	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M. (Eastern). Enjoy!
1/27/2016 19:33:57	Twitter for Android	Even though I beat him in the first six debates, especially the last one, Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?
1/27/2016 19:01:01	Twitter for Android	Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic!
1/27/2016 13:02:52	Twitter for Android	The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. Who would ever say something so nasty &amp; dumb
1/26/2016 18:40:09	Twitter Web Client	Do you think @SenTedCruz knows about @bobvanderplaats dealings? Actually, I doubt it!
1/26/2016 18:03:07	Twitter Web Client	.@bobvanderplaats begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100,000 for himself—a bad guy!
1/26/2016 15:55:01	Twitter for Android	Why doesn't phony  @bobvanderplaats tell his followers all the times he asked for him and his family to stay at my hotels-didn't like paying
1/26/2016 11:17:29	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria  @FoxBusiness at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy.
1/26/2016 10:43:04	Twitter for Android	I will be doing @GMA @GStephanopoulos this morning at around 7:00. Likewise, I will be doing @Morning_Joe at around 7:00. Figure it out!
1/25/2016 21:02:18	Twitter Web Client	I will be on Morning's with Maria on the Fox Business Network tomorrow during the 7am and 8am ET hours.
1/25/2016 16:51:55	Twitter Web Client	I will be on The Situation Room with @wolfblitzer from 5-7pm est on CNN
1/25/2016 13:26:21	Twitter for Android	It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada, or get out of race
1/24/2016 14:13:08	Twitter for Android	I will be on Face The Nation this morning at various times across the U.S. @CBSNews  Enjoy!
1/24/2016 14:06:08	Twitter for Android	I will be on @meetthepress this morning at various times across the U.S. @NBCNews  Enjoy!
1/23/2016 16:50:22	Twitter for Android	Heading to Sioux County, Iowa, where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!
1/23/2016 15:07:04	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was, until recently, a Canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run!
1/23/2016 15:01:34	Twitter for Android	I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull, politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!
1/23/2016 14:45:31	Twitter for Android	.@AnnCoulter has been amazing. We will win and establish strong borders, we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay. We will be great again!
1/23/2016 13:29:33	Twitter for Android	I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm!
1/22/2016 23:08:31	Twitter for Android	Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.
1/22/2016 22:56:54	Twitter for Android	Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good - great new polls!
1/22/2016 20:47:34	Twitter for Android	The dying @NRO National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama. They have been losing for years. I will beat Hillary!
1/22/2016 15:42:18	Twitter for Android	After spending $89 million, @JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. He is ashamed to use the name "Bush" in ads. Low energy guy!
1/22/2016 14:24:15	Twitter for Android	The failing @NRO National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate
1/22/2016 13:54:21	Twitter for Android	Highly respected Constitutional law professor Mary Brigid McManamon has just stated, "Ted Cruz is not eligible to be President." Big problem
1/22/2016 13:34:54	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain, but without it we wouldn't have roads, highways, airports, schools or even pipelines.
1/21/2016 20:40:07	Twitter for Android	Happy birthday to my friend, the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy!
1/21/2016 14:32:57	Twitter for Android	Low energy candidate @JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax!
1/21/2016 14:19:26	Twitter for Android	Sad sack @JebBush has just done another ad on me, with special interest money, saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me.
1/21/2016 14:04:54	Twitter for Android	So sad that @CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!
1/21/2016 13:42:48	Twitter for Android	Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing, crying, lost soul!
1/19/2016 18:47:51	Twitter for Android	Wow, the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that "Ted Cruz must be defeated." Big shoker! People do not like Ted.
1/19/2016 12:50:01	Twitter for Android	Wow, new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!
1/19/2016 1:57:26	Twitter for Android	I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!
1/19/2016 1:50:57	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!
1/17/2016 21:05:47	Twitter for Android	I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.
1/17/2016 20:57:35	Twitter for Android	Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore!
1/17/2016 15:21:46	Twitter for Android	Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus!
1/17/2016 13:51:56	Twitter for Android	In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!
1/16/2016 13:31:10	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
1/16/2016 12:23:00	Twitter for Android	Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
1/16/2016 12:17:32	Twitter for Android	Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
1/16/2016 12:12:45	Twitter for Android	The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
1/16/2016 11:52:46	Twitter for Android	Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
1/16/2016 11:49:02	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
1/16/2016 11:40:13	Twitter for Android	Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
1/16/2016 2:47:22	Twitter for Android	More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.
1/16/2016 2:18:52	Twitter for Android	.@FrankLuntz is a total clown. Has zero credibility!  @FoxNews  @megynkelly
1/16/2016 2:02:12	Twitter for Android	.@oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing @glennbeck that I supported John McCain big league in 2008, not Obama!
1/16/2016 1:45:55	Twitter for Android	Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon!
1/16/2016 1:41:10	Twitter for Android	.@GeraldoRivera  Thank you Geraldo for your nice words on @oreillyfactor tonight. You are a true champion! Thank @ericbolling - great guy!
1/14/2016 19:25:16	Twitter for Android	Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated.
1/13/2016 14:26:25	Twitter for Android	Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!
1/13/2016 12:09:54	Twitter for Android	Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!
1/13/2016 5:46:27	Twitter for Android	Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!
1/13/2016 4:32:24	Twitter for Android	The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!
1/12/2016 19:40:28	Twitter Web Client	On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!
1/12/2016 4:22:59	Twitter for Android	The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes. Enjoy!
1/12/2016 4:19:17	Twitter for Android	.@stuartpstevens horrible advise to Mitt Romney made victory an impossibility. Don't blame Mitt! Now Stevens can't get a job!
1/12/2016 3:34:17	Twitter for Android	Fantastic job on @CNN  tonight. @kayleighmcenany is a winner! @donlemon
1/12/2016 2:49:57	Twitter for Android	Don't forget to watch The Tonight Show with the wonderful @jimmyfallon at 11:30 P.M. You will not be disappointed!  @NBC
1/12/2016 2:42:49	Twitter for Android	Face The Nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years. Congratulations and WOW!  @CBSNews @jdickerson
1/12/2016 1:49:59	Twitter for Android	.@MajorCBS Major Garrett of @CBSNews covers me very inaccurately. Total agenda, bad reporter!
1/12/2016 1:46:13	Twitter for Android	Thank you Michael Harrison @Talkersmagazine for your kind words - greatly appreciated!
1/11/2016 20:20:54	Twitter Web Client	.@megynkelly recently said that she can’t be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!
1/10/2016 18:31:47	Twitter for Android	Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!
1/10/2016 18:28:54	Twitter for Android	In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1/10/2016 18:23:57	Twitter for Android	Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!
1/9/2016 15:41:44	Twitter for Android	Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says "wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled).
1/9/2016 14:26:28	Twitter for Android	South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!
1/9/2016 14:22:36	Twitter for Android	Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!
1/8/2016 23:39:37	Twitter for Android	Will be at venue, in wonderful South Carolina, very soon. Big traffic back-up, tremendous crowd! Will be wild.
1/8/2016 15:57:17	Twitter for Android	Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!
1/5/2016 17:42:47	Twitter Web Client	I don’t know @SamuelLJackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him &amp; think he does too many TV commercials—boring. Not a fan.
1/5/2016 16:53:31	Twitter Web Client	Wow @UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75,000 to around 10—bad management. No wonder they begged me for ads.
1/3/2016 20:00:58	Twitter for Android	Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia &amp; their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!
1/3/2016 17:55:26	Twitter for Android	Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.
1/3/2016 14:27:19	Twitter for Android	Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!
1/3/2016 14:12:02	Twitter for Android	Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner &amp; if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!
1/3/2016 13:59:20	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.
1/3/2016 5:36:40	Twitter for Android	Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.
1/3/2016 0:24:45	Twitter for Android	Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally. Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. Will be an amazing evening!
1/2/2016 21:07:34	Twitter for Android	Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!
1/2/2016 21:01:10	Twitter for Android	When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!
1/2/2016 20:04:58	Twitter for Android	I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!
1/2/2016 20:00:17	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!
1/2/2016 13:23:00	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!
1/2/2016 12:17:12	Twitter for Android	.@JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!
1/2/2016 12:10:21	Twitter for Android	.@JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!
1/1/2016 23:40:51	Twitter for Android	The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!
1/1/2016 23:24:13	Twitter for Android	I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.
1/1/2016 23:00:09	Twitter for Android	Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!
1/1/2016 0:44:14	Twitter for Android	I will be on @FoxNews live,  with members of my family, at 11:50 P.M. We will ring in the New Year together! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
12/31/2015 23:21:49	Twitter for Android	I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!
12/31/2015 23:11:35	Twitter for Android	Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD!
12/31/2015 15:07:18	Twitter for Android	I would feel sorry for @JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me
12/31/2015 10:04:36	Twitter for Android	People ask, "why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about @JebBush when he is so low in the polls?" Because of his big $ hit ads on me!
12/31/2015 5:10:16	Twitter for Android	.@JebBush has spent  $63,000,000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN!  @hughhewitt
12/31/2015 4:15:32	Twitter for Android	A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
12/31/2015 4:11:37	Twitter for Android	I predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper, which has been run into the ground by publisher "Stinky" Joe McQuaid, will be dead in 2 years!
12/30/2015 15:52:41	Twitter for Android	I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed  @RichLowry on television lately, and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity
12/30/2015 13:08:07	Twitter for Android	Iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. I'm now in Florida, getting ready to go to South Carolina. Big crowd, very exciting
12/30/2015 12:31:59	Twitter for Android	.@CharlesHurt   You were great on @seanhannity last night. Thanks for the nice words. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
12/29/2015 18:50:05	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later today. Despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
12/29/2015 14:39:30	Twitter for Android	So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million &amp; done. Run country my way!
12/29/2015 14:33:51	Twitter for Android	My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.
12/29/2015 4:39:36	Twitter for Android	.@jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @FoxNews - he really gets it!
12/29/2015 4:31:18	Twitter for Android	Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist!
12/28/2015 13:34:30	Twitter for Android	Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double &amp; triple them, a disaster!
12/28/2015 12:50:23	Twitter for Android	Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!
12/28/2015 12:42:06	Twitter for Android	Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!
12/28/2015 12:30:43	Twitter for Android	The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD
12/28/2015 12:12:10	Twitter for Android	If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!
12/28/2015 3:03:29	Twitter for Android	Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!
12/27/2015 16:59:15	Twitter for Android	Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC
12/27/2015 16:49:55	Twitter for Android	.@BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!
12/27/2015 16:25:35	Twitter for Android	The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!
12/27/2015 16:19:51	Twitter for Android	R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!
12/27/2015 16:04:38	Twitter for Android	It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!
12/27/2015 3:05:19	Twitter for Android	I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!
12/27/2015 0:31:07	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!
12/25/2015 20:31:40	Twitter for Android	Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!
12/25/2015 20:24:41	Twitter for Android	Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.
12/25/2015 20:15:25	Twitter for Android	We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
12/25/2015 20:11:18	Twitter for Android	Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!
12/25/2015 19:38:17	Twitter for Android	.@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!
12/25/2015 2:55:58	Twitter for Android	Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!
12/25/2015 2:22:42	Twitter for Android	.@danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!
12/25/2015 1:56:08	Twitter for Android	.@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!
12/24/2015 23:28:54	Twitter for Android	I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
12/24/2015 23:04:08	Twitter for Android	.@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!
12/24/2015 22:56:55	Twitter for Android	Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!
12/24/2015 22:42:10	Twitter for Android	Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!
12/24/2015 22:35:38	Twitter for Android	Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly
12/24/2015 22:31:41	Twitter for Android	Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!
12/24/2015 22:20:24	Twitter for Android	Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!
12/24/2015 22:14:10	Twitter for Android	In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!
12/24/2015 20:10:14	Twitter for Android	Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!
12/24/2015 3:22:59	Twitter for Android	Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity
12/23/2015 23:17:09	Twitter for Android	Hillary, when you complain about "a penchant for sexism," who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!
12/23/2015 17:20:55	Twitter for Android	It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead
12/23/2015 15:55:23	Twitter for Android	Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump
12/23/2015 15:49:01	Twitter for Android	.@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!
12/23/2015 14:55:24	Twitter for Android	The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad
12/23/2015 14:20:57	Twitter for Android	The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.
12/23/2015 12:02:24	Twitter for Android	Big news just out - NEW @CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10
12/23/2015 6:02:10	Twitter for Android	We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!
12/23/2015 5:48:08	Twitter for Android	It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!
12/23/2015 3:37:51	Twitter for Android	When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!
12/23/2015 2:59:33	Twitter for Android	Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!
12/22/2015 22:50:23	Twitter for Android	Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!
12/22/2015 22:39:11	Twitter for Android	Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!
12/22/2015 21:25:08	Twitter Web Client	.@JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around, incoherent.
12/22/2015 21:23:57	Twitter Web Client	Why doesn't @JebBush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate?
12/22/2015 21:22:50	Twitter Web Client	Will @JebBush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?
12/22/2015 21:20:33	Twitter Web Client	.@JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work!
12/22/2015 21:19:16	Twitter Web Client	Weak and low energy @JebBush, whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.
12/21/2015 20:08:37	Twitter for Android	Getting ready to leave for Michigan - will be an amazing evening! See you there.
12/21/2015 18:51:21	Twitter for Android	Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about "the video" of me being used by ISIS. There is no video.
12/21/2015 18:14:38	Twitter for Android	Thanks @AndreaTantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts. Big progress is being made. Keep up the great work!
12/21/2015 18:08:46	Twitter for Android	A suicide bomber has just killed U.S. troops in Afghanistan. When will our leaders get tough and smart. We are being led to slaughter!
12/21/2015 17:38:03	Twitter Web Client	It's the Democrats' total weakness &amp; incompetence that gave rise to ISIS --  not a tape of Donald Trump that was an admitted Hillary lie!
12/21/2015 15:20:43	Twitter for Android	Getting ready to go to the great State of Michigan. Big crowd tonight. Make America Great Again!
12/21/2015 12:52:56	Twitter for Android	Just out: TRUMP GOP DEBATE - 18,000,000. CLINTON DEMOCRAT DEBATE - 6,700,000. And they were on major network vs. cable!
12/21/2015 12:34:40	Twitter for Android	Hillary said with respect to ISIS, "we are finally where we need to be." Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership?  MAGA!
12/21/2015 11:51:04	Twitter for Android	I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video.
12/21/2015 11:47:58	Twitter for Android	Hillary said at debate ISIS is "going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst." She made up story-want apology!
12/21/2015 11:41:30	Twitter for Android	Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened!
12/21/2015 2:49:09	Twitter for Android	.@MissUniverse final 3 on now. Great people, great new owner @IMG. WATCH.
12/20/2015 23:44:10	Twitter for Android	It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential!
12/20/2015 23:37:15	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!
12/20/2015 23:13:09	Twitter for Android	.@JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today. Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. A basket case!
12/20/2015 9:05:41	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton lied when she said that "ISIS is using video of Donald Trump as a recruiting tool." This was fact checked by @FoxNews: FALSE
12/20/2015 3:44:41	Twitter for Android	.@GStephanopoulos stupidly believes that Hillary wants to run against me because she said so. She says that so people believe it - opposite!
12/19/2015 19:25:05	Twitter for Android	President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint, and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747.
12/19/2015 15:56:51	Twitter for Android	See, Sanders backed Hillary on E-mails at the debate, hurting himself, and then she threw him under the bus (but failed). Disloyal person!
12/18/2015 20:59:05	Twitter for Android	The last thing our country needs is another BUSH! Dumb as a rock!
12/18/2015 20:43:44	Twitter Web Client	.@JebBush has embarrassed himself &amp; his family with his incompetent campaign for President. He should remain true to himself.
12/18/2015 19:50:19	Twitter Web Client	Weak &amp; ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!
12/18/2015 18:25:35	Twitter Web Client	I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name &amp; don’t be ashamed of it!
12/18/2015 18:02:12	Twitter Web Client	.@MelindaDC  Don’t misrepresent in order to make a point. I was always tough on ISIS--as you’ll find out after I get elected.
12/16/2015 15:29:30	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton is weak and ineffective - no strength, no stamina.
12/16/2015 15:20:57	Twitter for Android	Jeb Bush had a tough night at the debate. Now he'll probably take some of his special interest money, he is their puppet, and buy ad's.
12/16/2015 14:58:14	Twitter for Android	Thank you for the nice words @ktmcfarland. The debate was interesting, and fun. Keep up the great work!
12/16/2015 14:53:20	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M. Will be talking about the debate, and more!
12/16/2015 13:49:35	Twitter for Android	Bill O'Reilly calls Trump and  campaign brilliant. In first place by 27 points.
12/16/2015 13:46:22	Twitter for Android	.@MarkHalperin works so hard but just doesn't have a natural instinct for politics. Others do, and those are the people you want to follow!
12/16/2015 13:40:25	Twitter for Android	Thank you @davidaxelrod for your nice words this morning on @CNN. It was a good night!
12/16/2015 13:29:47	Twitter for Android	Thank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night. All polls agree. It was fun and interesting!
12/15/2015 23:12:52	Twitter for Android	Highly respected PUBLIC POLICY POLLING (PPP) just announced that I am number one in IOWA. Thank you!
12/15/2015 17:38:52	Twitter for Android	. #JoeTheismann was great as a political analyst on @FoxNews. He knows far more than football. Thanks for the nice words Joe!
12/15/2015 17:23:03	Twitter for Android	I won every debate so far according to all debate polls including @DRUDGE_REPORT, @TIME @Slate and more. Too bad dopey @megynkelly lies!
12/15/2015 17:12:39	Twitter for Android	Between Iraq war monger @krauthammer, dummy @KarlRove, deadpan @GeorgezWill, highly overrated @megynkelly, among others, @FoxNews not fair!
12/15/2015 15:47:29	Twitter for Android	I am in Trump International Hotel, Las Vegas, getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight. Look forward -   hope I get treated fairly!
12/15/2015 15:40:47	Twitter for Android	I wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. No matter how well I do - bad!
12/15/2015 15:34:25	Twitter for Android	.@megynkelly is very bad at math. She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14.
12/15/2015 15:30:25	Twitter for Android	.@megynkelly, the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews, worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15!
12/15/2015 14:54:17	Twitter for Android	Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead. They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press
12/15/2015 14:47:56	Twitter for Android	Isn't it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll, which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13%, 33% to 20% - then doesn't use it
12/15/2015 14:29:02	Twitter for Android	Wow, I just had two very good Iowa polls and a phenomenal just out National Poll from @ABC @washingtonpost - 38%.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
12/14/2015 0:33:04	Twitter for Android	People have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems!
12/13/2015 22:31:01	Twitter for Android	I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back, get caught, and then deny it. Well, welcome to the wonderful world of politics!
12/13/2015 22:23:19	Twitter for Android	I did interview with Chris Wallace of @FoxNews in order to be fair. He then puts on Rove, Lane and Will, three Trump bashers, to discuss.
12/13/2015 21:47:29	Twitter for Android	Many think that the Championship Course at Turnberry, home of The Duel In The Sun, will be the worlds best after the renovation.
12/13/2015 17:37:25	Twitter for Android	A very good NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll was just released wherein I went up from last month and am in the lead. Nice!
12/13/2015 5:28:50	Twitter for Android	Something must be done with dopey @KarlRove - he is pushing Republicans down the same old path of defeat. Don't fall for it, Karl is a loser
12/13/2015 4:57:25	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @jaketapper @CNN at 9:00 A.M. and Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:O0  A.M. CNN Iowa Poll -13 point lead!
12/12/2015 11:48:30	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A.M. So much to talk about!
12/12/2015 11:47:08	Twitter for Android	.@loudobbsnews did a fantastic interview with syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin. Congrats to both!
12/12/2015 4:55:41	Twitter for Android	Just got back from Iowa, great people!
12/11/2015 13:04:16	Twitter for Android	.@chucktodd is a nice guy , but just hopeless. He knows so little about politics and, in particular, winning!  I fixed his rating problem.
12/11/2015 12:59:25	Twitter for Android	.@Morning_Joe just went off the rails. I will beat Hillary easily - she does not want to run against me. I am tuning them out, waste of time
12/11/2015 12:53:34	Twitter for Android	.@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open - more fun that way!
12/11/2015 12:49:46	Twitter for Android	Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so, he will fall like all others. Will be easy!
12/11/2015 12:45:08	Twitter for Android	.@Morning_Joe is so off on Iowa, which I am leading big in new @CNN poll. I will win Iowa. Also, I beat Hillary easily!
12/11/2015 11:34:50	Twitter for Android	Great evening last night in  New Hampshire. Got the endorsement from the New England Police Union - big  territory, great people! Thank you.
12/11/2015 4:44:00	Twitter for Android	.@BernardGoldberg was not good tonight on @oreillyfactor. He just doesn't know about winning! But he is a nice guy.
12/10/2015 17:56:19	Twitter Web Client	Establishment flunky @KarlRove is going crazy with the just released CBS poll that has me way ahead. New Fox poll has me beating Hillary.
12/10/2015 17:53:38	Twitter Web Client	Dummy @KarlRove continues to make and write false statements. He still thinks Romney won--he should get a life!
12/10/2015 12:49:41	Twitter for Android	The United Kingdom is trying hard to disguise their massive  Muslim problem. Everybody is wise to what is happening, very sad! Be honest.
12/10/2015 12:12:04	Twitter for Android	I have decided to postpone my trip to Israel and to schedule my meeting with @Netanyahu at a later date after I become President of the U.S.
12/10/2015 12:00:15	Twitter for Android	Our VISA system is broken, like so much else in our country. We better get it fixed really fast. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
12/10/2015 11:50:45	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends this morning at 7:30. So much to talk about!
12/10/2015 11:44:11	Twitter for Android	Wow, my poll numbers have just been announced and have gone through the roof!
12/10/2015 4:48:19	Twitter for Android	.@Megynkelly spent a big part of her show talking about other shows spending so much time on me. Really weird, she's being driven crazy!
12/10/2015 4:24:40	Twitter for Android	Weak and totally conflicted people like @TheRickWilson shouldn't be allowed on television unless given an I.Q. test. Dumb as a rock!  @CNN
12/10/2015 4:15:56	Twitter for Android	Great interview tonight @donlemon - very professionally done. @CNN
12/10/2015 3:16:44	Twitter for Android	Thank you @oreillyfactor for your wonderful editorial as to why I should have been @TIME Magazine's Person of the Year. You should run Time!
12/10/2015 2:25:58	Twitter for Android	Why does @CNN bore their audience with people like @secupp, a totally biased loser who doesn't have a clue. I hear she will soon be gone!
12/10/2015 2:15:31	Twitter for Android	.@secupp, who can't believe that her candidate has bombed so badly, is one of the dumber pundits on T.V. Hard to watch, zero talent! @CNN
12/10/2015 2:08:42	Twitter for Android	.@donlemon on @CNN at 10:00 P.M.
12/9/2015 23:47:29	Twitter for Android	I am interviewed on the  @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00. Then at 10:00, I am interviewed by @donlemon on @CNN. Enjoy!
12/9/2015 16:01:25	Twitter Web Client	.@Mayor_Nutter of Philadelphia, who is doing a terrible job, should be ashamed for using such a disgusting word in referring to me.Low life!
12/9/2015 13:53:59	Twitter for Android	I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who is ruining Germany
12/9/2015 13:17:21	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton does not have the STRENGTH or STAMINA to be President. We need strong and super smart for our next leader - or trouble!
12/9/2015 13:14:17	Twitter for Android	The last person corrupt Hillary Clinton wants to run against is Donald J. Trump. I'll end up beating her in every state. New Fox Poll-Trump!
12/9/2015 12:06:06	Twitter for Android	The failing @nytimes does not mention the new @CNN Poll that has me leading Iowa by a massive 13 points - I am at 33%. Maggie Haberman, sad!
12/9/2015 4:21:15	Twitter for Android	Great poll numbers just coming out of New Hampshire. BIG lead for "Trump" according to @CNN!
12/9/2015 4:15:51	Twitter for Android	Wow, what a day. So many foolish people that refuse to acknowledge the tremendous  danger and uncertainty of certain people coming into U.S.
12/9/2015 2:56:41	Twitter for Android	Our country is facing a major threat from radical Islamic terrorism. We better get very smart, and very tough, FAST, before it is too late!
12/8/2015 23:14:19	Twitter for Android	Will be on @ABC News tonight at 6:30. Interviewed by the legendary @BarbaraJWalters! Enjoy

12/8/2015 20:50:50	Twitter Web Client	A very big poll is coming out at 6 PM in New Hampshire. Will be very interested in the results.
12/8/2015 14:30:04	Twitter for Android	I wish the @WSJ Wall Street Journal had reported the just out @CNN Iowa Poll correctly. I lead by a wide margin,13 points, going up big!
12/8/2015 14:25:21	Twitter for Android	Just won IOWA @CNN Poll BIG: Trump 33% Cruz 20% Rubio 11%,  but @WSJ reported "Cruz momentum" but nothing about the fact that I easily won!
12/7/2015 15:22:48	Twitter for Android	If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!
12/7/2015 15:18:25	Twitter for Android	The @washingtonpost loses   money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon! Big tax shelter
12/7/2015 15:08:20	Twitter for Android	The @washingtonpost, which loses a fortune, is owned by  @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon.
12/7/2015 14:04:23	Twitter for Android	N.Y.C. has the worst Mayor in the United States. I hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets, the homeless and crime! Disgrace
12/7/2015 13:44:45	Twitter for Android	I spoke with other candidates to a Jewish group, many friends, in D.C. I said "I'm a negotiator like you" Got standing O-rated best of day!
12/7/2015 5:50:31	Twitter for Android	Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes. What sport is he talking about, and who? Is Obama profiling?
12/7/2015 5:32:32	Twitter for Android	Thank you Graham Ledger of the Daily Ledger @OANN for your really fair coverage and your great interview with Peter Roff of U.S. NEWS &amp; W.R.
12/7/2015 1:45:34	Twitter for Android	Well, Obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.
12/7/2015 1:28:13	Twitter for Android	Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying).
12/7/2015 1:27:05	Twitter for Android	Wish Obama would say ISIS, like almost everyone else, rather than ISIL.
12/7/2015 1:16:34	Twitter for Android	Is that all there is? We need a new President - FAST!
12/7/2015 1:01:53	Twitter for Android	Hope he won't spend too much time ripping apart the 2nd. Amendment!
12/7/2015 0:58:30	Twitter for Android	The podium in the Oval Office looks odd! Not good, but the words will be the key.
12/7/2015 0:55:56	Twitter for Android	Hillary won't call out radical Islam! She will be soundly defeated.
12/7/2015 0:51:24	Twitter for Android	I will be re-tweeting some of your better, most imaginative and hopefully insightful tweets. Make them good (great)! Important stuff.
12/7/2015 0:27:17	Twitter for Android	BIG NIGHT ON TWITTER TONIGHT. I WILL BE LIVE TWEETING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH AT 7:50 P.M. ( EASTERN). MUST TALK RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM!
12/7/2015 0:09:07	Twitter for Android	Gee, @meetthepress with @chucktodd was getting terrible ratings then, with me,  he set records - I saved his job, but Chuck still not nice!
12/6/2015 19:39:58	Twitter for Android	Wow, @GeorgeWill said some very nice things about me today on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace. I am making progress, thanks George!
12/6/2015 19:24:21	Twitter for Android	I will be live-tweeting President Obama's prime-time speech tonight starting at 7:50 P.M. (Eastern).Will he finally state the real problems?
12/6/2015 17:58:33	Twitter for Android	.@BrookslawBrooks  Thank you so much for your nice words. I will make you look very smart!
12/6/2015 14:39:17	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on Face The Nation @CBSNews at 10:30 A.M. Should be interesting - ENJOY!
12/6/2015 14:32:50	Twitter for Android	Was going to do a phoner this morning with @jaketapper on @CNN but they could not get their phone equipment to hook in. Will do next week.
12/6/2015 0:42:36	Twitter for Android	Wonder if Obama will ever say RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST?
12/5/2015 12:35:37	Twitter for Android	Raleigh, North Carolina, was fantastic last night. Such incredible spirit. We all want to, and will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
12/4/2015 10:18:32	Twitter for Android	.@MarkHalperin I totaly won the RJC meeting yesterday. Know many members who said "not even close." Only FULL standing O. But don't want $'s
12/3/2015 13:08:23	Twitter for Android	As a presidential candidate, I have instructed my long-time doctor to issue, within two weeks, a full medical report-it will show perfection
12/3/2015 12:19:11	Twitter for Android	I consider my health, stamina and strength one of my greatest assets.The world has watched me for many years and can so testify-great genes!
12/3/2015 11:52:53	Twitter for Android	Congratulations on the GREAT job done by POLICE and law enforcement on the California shootings. Give credit where credit is due.
12/2/2015 20:38:08	Twitter for Android	California shooting looks very bad. Good luck to law enforcement and God bless. This is when our police are so appreciated!
12/2/2015 20:19:22	Twitter for Android	I beat Hillary in the new @FoxNews Poll head to head.  SHE HAS NO STRENGTH OR STAMINA, both of which are needed to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
12/2/2015 12:25:09	Twitter for Android	I WILL BE ON @foxandfriends  AT 7:30 -NOW!
12/1/2015 21:46:36	Twitter for Android	Just arrived in New Hampshire. Another packed venue! Will be fun.
12/1/2015 15:16:07	Twitter Web Client	Jamiel Shaw was incredible on @foxandfriends this morning. His son, who was viciously killed by an illegal immigrant, is so proud of pop!
12/1/2015 15:06:41	Twitter Web Client	I want to thank all my friends in Macon for the special evening and great reception. What a crowd of incredible people!
11/30/2015 21:17:23	Twitter for Android	Meeting with African American Pastors at Trump Tower was amazing. Wonderful news conference followed. Now off to Georgia for big speech!
11/30/2015 15:23:33	Twitter Web Client	The Republican establishment, out of self preservation, is concerned w/ my high poll #'s. More concerned are Dems—I beat Hillary heads up!
11/30/2015 12:44:45	Twitter for Android	When will @CNN get some real political talent rather than political commentators like Errol Louis, who doesn't have a clue! Others bad also.
11/30/2015 1:25:19	Twitter for Android	Great job @MariaTCardona on @ThisWeekABC. You made kooky Cokie Roberts and @BillKristol look even dumber than they are. You will be right!
11/29/2015 21:41:43	Twitter for Android	After my meeting with the pastors, it's off to Georgia for a big rally - many thousands of great people will be there, a beautiful movement!
11/29/2015 21:37:33	Twitter for Android	Will be meeting on Monday at Trump Tower with a large group of African American Pastors. Many I know-wonderful people! Not a press event.
11/29/2015 21:31:35	Twitter for Android	Just watched Cookie Roberts on @ABC. Her predictions have been so wrong for so long that she has lost all credibility. Just another sad case
11/29/2015 4:03:24	Twitter for Android	.@CNN has to do better reporting if it wants to keep up with the crowd.So totally one-sided and biased against me that it is becoming boring
11/29/2015 3:51:27	Twitter for Android	I will be on @meetthepress in an interview with @chucktodd on Sunday morning. So much to talk about!
11/29/2015 0:22:18	Twitter for Android	The Sarasota, Florida, rally today was amazing. 12,000 people chanting their love for our country. It's going to happen, this is a MOVEMENT!
11/29/2015 0:03:13	Twitter for Android	.@CNN Kayleigh McEnany was great on you network today. You should have her  on more often! Thank you Kayleigh for your nice words.
11/28/2015 14:38:18	Twitter for Android	Virtually no-one has spent more money in helping the  American people with disabilities than me. Will discuss today at my speech in Sarasota
11/28/2015 14:32:29	Twitter for Android	The reporter who pulled-back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun. I don't know what he looks like and don't know him!
11/26/2015 21:46:31	Twitter for Android	The failing @nytimes should focus on fair and balanced reporting rather than constant hit jobs on me. Yesterday 3 boring articles, today2!
11/26/2015 21:40:30	Twitter for Android	I do not know the reporter for the @nytimes, or what he looks like. I was showing a person groveling to take back a statement made long ago!
11/26/2015 12:52:15	Twitter for Android	Happy Thanksgiving to all. Have a great day and look forward to the future. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
11/26/2015 1:51:00	Twitter for Android	The numbers at the @nytimes  are so dismal, especially advertising revenue, that big help will be needed fast. A once great institution-SAD!
11/26/2015 1:41:15	Twitter for Android	So, since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade, why do people care what they write. Incompetent!
11/26/2015 1:35:50	Twitter for Android	The dopes at the @nytimes bought the Boston Globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00. Their great old headquarters-gave it away! So dumb
11/26/2015 1:29:29	Twitter for Android	The @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control. With unfunded liabilities-big trouble!
11/25/2015 4:36:24	Twitter for Android	A wonderful evening in South Carolina - big crowd, amazing energy!
11/24/2015 21:08:29	Twitter Web Client	Will be doing @seanhannity at 10 PM on @FoxNews.  As always with Sean, will be interesting!
11/24/2015 20:54:08	Twitter Web Client	Heading to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Really big crowd—so much to talk about!
11/24/2015 20:02:19	Twitter Web Client	Republicans must stop relying on losers like @KarlRove if they want to start winning presidential elections. Be tough and get smart!
11/23/2015 22:18:34	Twitter for Android	Heading for Ohio - really big crowd of amazing people! Much to talk about!
11/23/2015 19:36:34	Twitter Web Client	.@WSJ reports that @GOP getting ready to treat me unfairly—big spending planned against me. That wasn’t the deal!
11/23/2015 18:45:58	Twitter Web Client	When you do your Christmas shopping remember how disloyal @Macys was to the subject of illegal immigration. #BoycottMacys #DumpMacys
11/23/2015 16:26:10	Twitter Web Client	Going to Columbus, Ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands. The silent majority is no longer silent!
11/23/2015 16:23:10	Twitter Web Client	.@AP has one of the worst reporters in the business -- @JeffHorwitz wouldn’t know the truth if it hit him in the face.
11/23/2015 16:22:42	Twitter Web Client	.@AP continues to do extremely dishonest reporting. Always looking for a hit to bring them back into relevancy—ain’t working!
11/22/2015 22:56:56	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton is weak on illegal immigration, among many other things. She is strong on corruption - corruption is what she's best at!
11/21/2015 21:49:04	Twitter for Android	.@heytana, great job - we are all proud of you!
11/21/2015 14:36:20	Twitter for Android	Heading to Birmingham, Alabama, and a massive crowd of incredible people! 12 noon - will be wild.
11/21/2015 14:29:03	Twitter for Android	We're stuck with the worst mayor in the United States. Too bad, but New York City will survive!
11/21/2015 13:13:13	Twitter for Android	People are really liking my new book, "Crippled America." Check it out!
11/21/2015 0:07:10	Twitter for Android	.@washingtonpost  @BretBaier  Please thank Charles Lane for his new found confidence. He has made a very good bet!
11/20/2015 23:57:39	Twitter for Android	.@Gracematters Thank you, a very wise bet! Best wishes.
11/20/2015 22:51:24	Twitter for Android	Just got back from South Carolina. Going to Alabama tomorrow!
11/20/2015 14:30:27	Twitter for Android	Going to South Carolina now, great place, SRO crowd. Iowa was amazing yesterday!
11/20/2015 13:00:30	Twitter for Android	The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. These are low level degenerates, NOT masterminds!
11/20/2015 12:50:14	Twitter for Android	The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders "MASTERMINDS." Call them instead thugs and losers. Young people must not go into ISIS!
11/19/2015 21:34:39	Twitter Web Client	The legendary Barbara Walters interviews Melania Trump and me on a special this Friday night at 10:00 on ABC. Don't miss it!
11/19/2015 18:11:58	Twitter for Android	The POLICE in Paris did a fantastic job. Very brave - not easy!
11/19/2015 16:30:16	Twitter Web Client	Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration &amp; the wall. After Paris, they’re all on the bandwagon.
11/19/2015 13:11:49	Twitter for Android	Eight Syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the U.S. ISIS maybe? I told you so. WE NEED A BIG &amp; BEAUTIFUL WALL!
11/17/2015 22:39:17	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed by  @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 on @FoxNews . Much, much, much to talk about!
11/17/2015 21:16:55	Twitter Web Client	Melania and I just had interview with the legendary @BarbaraJWalters. Watch #abc2020 this Friday. Tonight we talk ISIS @WNTonight
11/17/2015 20:48:53	Twitter Web Client	.@AP is doing very badly. I can say from experience their reporting is terrible &amp; highly inaccurate. Sadly, they are now irrelevant!
11/17/2015 20:48:34	Twitter Web Client	One of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great @AP. They have lost their way and are no longer credible.
11/17/2015 13:54:30	Twitter for Android	Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?
11/17/2015 13:19:03	Twitter for Android	I, along with almost everyone else, have so little confidence in President Obama. He has a horrible attitude-a man who is resigned to defeat
11/17/2015 13:14:52	Twitter for Android	So many great polls like Reuters - big leads everywhere. New Hampshire really special! We will win big and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
11/16/2015 23:09:23	Twitter for Android	Just landing in Knoxville, Tennessee! Massive crowd expected! Will all have a great time, despite serious subject matter.
11/16/2015 20:23:43	Twitter Web Client	Republicans must stop listening to dopes like @KarlRove who still insists Mitt Romney won the last election. Think big &amp; think strong!
11/16/2015 18:47:19	Twitter Web Client	Wow, @Macys shares are down more than 40% this year. I never knew my ties &amp; shirts not being sold there would have such a big impact!
11/16/2015 12:43:30	Twitter for Android	Remember, I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago. Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil.
11/16/2015 1:09:01	Twitter for Android	Tom Brady just did it again. He is not only a great guy, he is, without question, the BEST quarterback!
11/16/2015 1:03:21	Twitter for Android	President Obama just told President Putin how important the Russian air strikes against ISIS have been. I TOLD YOU SO!
11/16/2015 0:57:48	Twitter for Android	.@JohnLegere  @TMobile  John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers.
11/16/2015 0:10:29	Twitter for Android	Glad to see that @RondaRousey lost her championship fight last night. Was soundly beaten - not a nice person!
11/15/2015 23:47:06	Twitter for Android	I have watched sloppy Graydon Carter fail and close Spy Magazine and now am watching him fail at @VanityFair Magazine. He is a total loser!
11/15/2015 23:39:05	Twitter for Android	.@VanityFair Magazine is doing really poorly. It has gotten worse and worse over the years, and has lost almost all of it's former allure!
11/15/2015 20:48:09	Twitter for Android	We need strong, tough and brilliant leadership now more than ever!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
11/15/2015 20:46:01	Twitter for Android	I had a great time in Texas yesterday. A tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people. Will be back soon!
11/15/2015 14:18:42	Twitter for Android	When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? He  can't say it, and unless he will,  the problem will not be solved!
11/15/2015 3:57:36	Twitter for Android	I think everyone will like my new and very successful book, Crippled America. Go get it and let me know what you think!
11/15/2015 3:52:24	Twitter for Android	Wow, Bernie Sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10% (it is actually over 20%) and for  African American youth - 51%.
11/15/2015 3:40:02	Twitter for Android	Hillary and Sanders are not doing well, but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage? O'Malley is a clown.
11/15/2015 3:30:52	Twitter for Android	Why won't President Obama use the term Islamic Terrorism? Isn't it now, after all of this time and so much death, about time!
11/14/2015 13:42:27	Twitter for Android	We need much tougher, much smarter leadership - and we need it NOW!
11/14/2015 13:39:56	Twitter for Android	President Obama said "ISIL continues to shrink" in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE.
11/13/2015 21:04:01	Twitter for Android	.@seanhannity  Carly, whose campaign is dead, is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope! Sad.
11/13/2015 20:55:51	Twitter for Android	.@CarlyFiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign!
11/13/2015 20:18:12	Twitter Web Client	.@CarlyFiorina I only said I was on @60Minutes four weeks ago with Putin—never said I was in Green Room. Separate pieces—great ratings!
11/13/2015 20:17:53	Twitter Web Client	.@CarlyFiorina  Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper &amp; pathological disease. I didn’t say it, he did. Apology?
11/13/2015 20:16:21	Twitter Web Client	.@CarlyFiorina Carly—I did graduate from Wharton and did very well. Who is your fact checker? Will you apologize?
11/13/2015 20:16:02	Twitter Web Client	.@CarlyFiorina Carly, not just you, I also told Gov. Kasich to “let Jeb talk, give him a chance” because Kasich was constantly cutting in.
11/12/2015 19:21:39	Twitter for Android	Wow, pres. candidate Ben Carson, who is very weak on illegal Immigration, just said  he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship.
11/12/2015 15:08:08	Twitter for Android	Why does the failing @WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy @KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper?
11/12/2015 15:00:34	Twitter for Android	.@KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP. This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100%
11/12/2015 12:50:11	Twitter for Android	We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!
11/12/2015 12:23:14	Twitter for Android	Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly!
11/12/2015 11:51:38	Twitter for Android	When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want "smart" trade deals.
11/12/2015 11:45:47	Twitter for Android	The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate.
11/12/2015 11:41:07	Twitter for Android	.@WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later.
11/12/2015 11:36:40	Twitter for Android	Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.
11/12/2015 11:24:16	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness at 7:30
11/12/2015 11:16:31	Twitter for Android	All seven on-line polls, including Drudge and Time, with thousands of respondents, said I won the debate. @krauthammer said I was "so, so."
11/11/2015 23:12:07	Twitter Web Client	Will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM.
11/11/2015 23:03:41	Twitter Web Client	I will be on @marklevinshow at 8PM tonight. Tune in!
11/11/2015 23:02:31	Twitter Web Client	.@gerardtbaker Gerard—wonderful job last night as moderator of the debate. I told many, “really smart and elegant.”
11/11/2015 22:59:49	Twitter Web Client	I never said that China was in the bad TPP trade deal but that China would come in the back door at a later date. @CNN @FoxBusiness
11/11/2015 16:36:36	Twitter Web Client	Just returned home from the great state of New Hampshire. Have made so many friends there--special place!
11/11/2015 16:34:53	Twitter Web Client	Happy Veterans Day. To those who have served, thank you for your special work.
11/11/2015 10:50:13	Twitter for Android	Loved doing the debate...won Drudge and all on-line polls! Amazing evening, moderators did an outstanding job.
11/11/2015 10:46:49	Twitter for Android	Will be on @Morning_Joe live from New Hampshire - 7:00 A.M. Talking about the debate and more!
11/10/2015 16:54:23	Twitter Web Client	Go out and buy CRIPPLED AMERICA: How to Make America Great Again. Doing really well. Great Thanksgiving or Christmas present!
11/10/2015 11:51:15	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed by @GStephanopoulos on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. There is much to talk about!
11/9/2015 0:47:41	Twitter for Android	Thank you to all of those who gave me such wonderful reviews for my performance on @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live. Best ratings in 4 years!
11/8/2015 22:17:36	Twitter for Android	.@EricShawnonFox Highest rated Saturday Night Live in four years. 47% higher than their opening night with Hillary &amp; Miley Cyrus. Nice words
11/8/2015 15:57:36	Twitter for Android	Television ratings for @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live just came out and they were great - the best since 2011. Very few protesters!
11/8/2015 13:19:08	Twitter for Android	.@nbcsnl - So much fun last night!
11/8/2015 12:16:42	Twitter for Android	Will be on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A.M.
11/8/2015 12:15:18	Twitter for Android	Amazing evening at Saturday Night Live!
11/8/2015 0:17:09	Twitter for Android	I am at the Saturday Night Live Studio - electricity all over the place. We will be doing a "tweeting" skit, so stay tuned!
11/7/2015 17:47:55	Twitter for Android	They are saying that tickets to tonight's Saturday Night Live are the hardest to get in the history of this great show! Off to a good start!
11/7/2015 17:34:50	Twitter for Android	Saturday Night Live has some incredible things in store tonight. The great thing about playing myself is that it will be authentic! Enjoy
11/7/2015 17:29:11	Twitter for Android	.@RobertGBeckel Please thank your brother for his nice words on television. Seems like a great guy and character! @CNN
11/7/2015 5:20:25	Twitter for Android	One of the dumbest political pundits on television is Chris Stirewalt of @FoxNews. Wrong facts - check Fox debate rankings, Trump #1. Dope!
11/7/2015 0:07:28	Twitter for Android	Would be nice if @jmartNYT learned how to read the polls before writing his next story. Probably done on purpose, but not good reporting!
11/6/2015 23:54:36	Twitter for Android	@BillKristol has become a sad case. His magazine is failing badly, probably doesn't have long to go, and his predictions are always wrong!
11/6/2015 19:47:32	Twitter Web Client	So sad that Obama rejected Keystone Pipeline. Thousands of jobs, good for the environment, no downside!
11/6/2015 19:33:30	Twitter Web Client	Happy Birthday to the great @BillyGraham. He's done so many wonderful things, not the least of which is his fantastic family. I love Billy!
11/6/2015 15:06:20	Twitter Web Client	.@AJDelgado13 Thank you so much for the nice words and support--really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts.
11/6/2015 14:48:35	Twitter Web Client	I think it would be a good idea—and fair—to include @GovChristie &amp; @MikeHuckabeeGOP in the debate. Both solid &amp; good guys. @FoxBusiness
11/6/2015 12:16:29	Twitter for Android	Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the @nytimes states that Carson "is trying to solidify his lead." But I am #1, easily! Sad
11/6/2015 11:58:25	Twitter for Android	Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.
11/6/2015 9:28:18	Twitter for Android	A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the @FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner!
11/6/2015 2:32:14	Twitter for Android	The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!
11/5/2015 9:17:13	Twitter for Android	.@seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I "ran for president twice." Never ran, merely considered running!
11/4/2015 14:58:00	Twitter for Android	Just landed in New Hampshire - a very exciting morning planned!
11/4/2015 13:28:10	Twitter for Android	Isn't it terrible that @megynkelly used a poll not used before (I.B.D.) when I was down, but refuses to use it now when I am up?
11/3/2015 11:06:27	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. and @foxandfriends at 7:50. Talking about my new book, out today, Crippled America.
11/2/2015 22:12:04	Twitter Web Client	Join me tomorrow, Nov. 3rd, at 12pm in #TrumpTowerNY. I’ll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA.  Don’t miss it!
11/2/2015 18:21:51	Twitter Web Client	.@CharlesMBlow  Why don’t you use new polls instead of the single ancient national poll that was a tiny bit negative. Dishonest reporting!
11/2/2015 13:31:58	Twitter for Android	Thank you Carl Higbie (former Navy Seal) for you support of my plan to straighten out the Veterans Administration-a mess!Great job @kilmeade
11/2/2015 12:24:05	Twitter for Android	.@Morning_Joe: Marco only won the debate in the minds of desperate people. I won every on-line poll, even crazy @CNBC. Marco good looking?
11/2/2015 11:42:56	Twitter for Android	Sirius National News at 7:30 A.M. Steve Bannon. @BreitbartNews
11/2/2015 2:17:37	Twitter for Android	Now that Iran ripped us off by making one of the best deals of any kind in history, they have just moved to block any imports from the U.S.
11/2/2015 1:54:57	Twitter for Android	Thank you @JoeTrippi for the nice, and true, words on #Media Buzz with terrific Howie Kurtz. Leading New Hampshire 30 to 12. @FoxNews
11/2/2015 0:00:40	Twitter for Android	While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages, one thing is clear:  That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP.
11/1/2015 14:03:53	Twitter for Android	If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!
11/1/2015 13:58:31	Twitter for Android	Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight".
11/1/2015 13:52:09	Twitter for Android	I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!
11/1/2015 13:48:26	Twitter for Android	Jeb's new slogan - "Jeb can fix it". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics!
11/1/2015 12:29:58	Twitter for Android	Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win
10/31/2015 23:21:44	Twitter for Android	.@thehill  John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show. I said "NO THANKS" Waste of time &amp; energy!
10/31/2015 23:13:46	Twitter for Android	Few people know that  @FortuneMagazine is still in business. Tell your writer  Alisa Soloman that I left The Apprentice to run for president
10/31/2015 22:31:29	Twitter for Android	No complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if I wasn't in them? Interesting question!
10/31/2015 22:24:19	Twitter for Android	Thank you James Freeman of the @WSJ for the very nice words. All polls said I won the debate except NBC (3rd). Explain to Daniel Henninger!
10/31/2015 19:17:45	Twitter for Android	Support Coach Kennedy and his right, together with his young players, to pray on the football field. Liberty Institute just suspended him!
10/31/2015 14:18:46	Twitter for Android	The @WSJ Wall Street Journal loves to write badly about me. They better be careful or I will unleash big time on them. Look forward to it!
10/31/2015 14:10:51	Twitter for Android	Lifting off right now for U.S.S. Wisconsin in Norfolk. See ya'
10/31/2015 13:48:06	Twitter for Android	I told you so-@politico just lost it's top person. Poor results and no money to pay him. If they were legit, they would be doing far better!
10/31/2015 12:28:51	Twitter for Android	I am leaving for Norfolk, Virginia - the great battleship U.S.S. Wisconsin - for a big rally and really big crowd. See you soon!
10/31/2015 12:23:15	Twitter for Android	I see Marco Rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his Superpac, which are total scams. Marco must address him as "SIR"!
10/31/2015 12:18:35	Twitter for Android	The new NBC POLL has me in first place but said I was third in the debate - I demand a recount (just kidding!). EVERY other poll had me #1.
10/31/2015 11:27:02	Twitter for Android	Black Lives Matter protesters totally disrupt Hillary Clinton event. She looked lost. This is not what we need with ISIS, CHINA, RUSSIA etc.
10/31/2015 4:30:23	Twitter for Android	I am going to save Medicare and Medicaid, Carson wants to abolish, and failing candidate Gov. John Kasich doesn't have a clue - weak!
10/31/2015 4:20:52	Twitter for Android	When candidate John Kasich, on the @oreillyfactor, talked about dismantling Medicare and Medicaid, he was referring to Ben Carson.
10/31/2015 1:46:49	Twitter for Android	.@GovMikeHuckabee Great job on @FoxNews tonight. Thanks for your nice words about my children. Class!
10/30/2015 18:57:39	Twitter Web Client	Super PACs should be disavowed by anyone running for President. They are a total scam on our system and country! I am self-funding.
10/30/2015 18:36:13	Twitter Web Client	Thank you @rushlimbaugh for your wonderful words. We will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
10/30/2015 18:08:16	Twitter Web Client	Happy Birthday to my wonderful daughter, @IvankaTrump.
10/30/2015 16:49:38	Twitter Web Client	Thank you @Morning_Joe for explaining to @CNN and @andersoncooper and so many others that I am leading in almost all national &amp; state polls.
10/30/2015 3:01:38	Twitter for Android	Thank you @CharlesHurt for  the nice words on @seanhannity. I will win and Make America Great Again!
10/30/2015 2:26:03	Twitter for Android	Loved doing the debate last night on @CNBC. Check out all of the polls! Everyone agrees that Harwood bombed!
10/30/2015 2:06:03	Twitter for Android	Wow, just heard really bad stuff about the failing  @politico. How much longer  will they be around? Some very untalented reporters.
10/29/2015 17:57:55	Twitter Web Client	Join me Tuesday, Nov. 3rd at 12pm in Trump Tower NYC.  I’ll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA.  Don’t miss it!
10/29/2015 15:50:24	Twitter for Android	.@SpeakerRyan Congratulations and good luck - you will do a GREAT job for our wonderful U.S.A.!
10/29/2015 15:42:23	Twitter for Android	Failing host @glennbeck, a mental basketcase, loves SUPERPACS - in other words, he wants your politicians totally controlled by lobbyists!
10/29/2015 13:25:15	Twitter for Android	Thank you to everybody for your wonderful comments on my debate performance - it was a lot of fun! Today I will be speaking in Reno, Nevada.
10/29/2015 12:48:32	Twitter for Android	Thank you @morningmika and @JoeNBC  for all of your nice words and comments on the debate!
10/29/2015 10:47:56	Twitter for Android	The money losing @politico is considered by many in the world of politics to be the dumbest and most slanted of the political sites. Losers!
10/28/2015 20:10:46	Twitter for Android	@CNBC  POLL  TOTAL: TRUMP 25.22  CARSON 19.78  RUBIO 9.67....
10/28/2015 18:22:36	Twitter for Android	.@TheEconomist Poll, one of the most highly respected, was just released. Wow, wait until the media digests these numbers - won't be happy!
10/28/2015 15:32:17	Twitter for Android	Does anybody think that @CNBC will get their fictitious  polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate. Sad!
10/28/2015 15:18:45	Twitter for Android	.@Morning_Joe can you believe Kasie Hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in Iowa. @politico is a scam!
10/28/2015 15:01:42	Twitter for Android	.@CNBC continues to report fictious poll numbers. Number one, based on every statistic, is Trump (by a wide margin). They just can't say it!
10/28/2015 14:53:25	Twitter for Android	After a great evening and packed auditorium in Iowa, I am now in Colorado looking forward to what I am sure will be a very unfair debate!
10/27/2015 18:52:20	Twitter for Android	I am leaving for Sioux City, Iowa - great event (rally).
10/27/2015 14:43:37	Twitter Web Client	New Gravis national poll just out --- 36%! Very nice! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
10/26/2015 22:19:56	Twitter for Android	Dopey @BillKristol, who has lost all credibility with so many dumb statements and  picks, said last week on @Morning_Joe that Biden was in.
10/26/2015 14:36:14	Twitter Web Client	All Presidential candidates should immediately disavow their Super PAC’s. They're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself
10/26/2015 14:35:28	Twitter Web Client	Re Super PAC scam:  What the other candidates are doing is a disgrace.
10/26/2015 14:35:13	Twitter Web Client	This whole Super PAC scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all PAC's &amp; is self-funding.
10/26/2015 0:06:43	Twitter for Android	Leaving for New Hampshire now. Will be doing the @TODAYshow there, live at 7:00 A.M. New @CBSNews Poll of New Hampshire: Trump 38 Carson 12!
10/25/2015 20:49:16	Twitter for Android	Remember that Carson, Bush and Rubio are VERY weak on illegal immigration. They will do NOTHING to stop it. Our country will be overrun!
10/25/2015 20:39:07	Twitter for Android	Do you think I will get credit for keeping Ford in U.S. Who cares, my supporters know the truth. Think what can be done as president!
10/25/2015 20:36:19	Twitter for Android	Word is that Ford Motor, because of my constant badgering at packed events, is going to cancel their deal to go to Mexico and stay in U.S.
10/25/2015 18:36:34	Twitter for Android	.@ByronYork  Great numbers from @CBSNews Poll. Also from ABC-Washington Post Poll. Thank you!  @CNN
10/25/2015 17:53:31	Twitter for Android	Do you believe that @FoxNews is still playing up the old Iowa poll numbers and no mention of the ABCWashington Post or just out CBS results?
10/25/2015 16:11:58	Twitter for Android	.@CBSNews Poll - WOW!  New Hampshire  TRUMP 38% CARSON 12% BUSH 8%  South Carolina TRUMP 40% CARSON 23% CRUZ 8% Iowa TRUMP 27% CARSON 27%
10/25/2015 14:29:51	Twitter for Android	Watch my interview on @CBSNews Face The Nation now and, also, the new CBS POLLS which, if good for me, the media won't report!
10/25/2015 13:40:57	Twitter for Android	Big poll comes out today on Face The Nation at 10:30 on @CBSNews.
10/25/2015 13:13:03	Twitter for Android	Watch @CNN at 9:00 A.M. @jaketapper. Then interviewed on @ABC @GStephanopoulos at 10:00 A.M. and then, at 10:30 A.M., watch Face The Nation.
10/25/2015 11:41:08	Twitter for Android	Ben Carson has never created a job in his life (well, maybe a nurse). I have created tens of thousands of jobs, it's what I do.
10/25/2015 11:34:59	Twitter for Android	I spell out some of the differences between Ben Carson and myself at 9:00 A.M. on @CNN @jaketapper. Ben is very weak on illegal immigration.
10/25/2015 11:18:17	Twitter for Android	A big POLL will be announced this morning on @CBSNews  Face The Nation. I wonder if I do well if the press will report the results? Doubt it
10/25/2015 10:36:39	Twitter for Android	This is just not the right time for Jeb Bush. His campaign is in total disarray, too much staff being paid way too much money = U.S. GOVT.
10/25/2015 3:24:42	Twitter for Android	While Jeb Bush is cutting staff and salaries, after having paid ridiculous amounts of money, why did he pay so much in the first place?
10/24/2015 18:22:39	Twitter for Android	Just finished speaking in Jacksonville, Florida. Incredible crowd, fantastic people. Thank you!
10/24/2015 13:46:17	Twitter for Android	Leaving for Jacksonville now. See you there! Miami was great.
10/24/2015 11:40:06	Twitter for Android	Massive crowds already forming in Jacksonville - will be and incredible day - 12 noon!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
10/22/2015 18:59:31	Twitter Web Client	The young intern who accidentally did a Retweet apologizes.
10/21/2015 17:24:35	Twitter Web Client	I think Joe Biden made correct decision for him &amp; his family. Personally, I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad.
10/21/2015 11:33:11	Twitter for Android	New poll by ABC News/Washington Post  TRUMP 32  CARSON 22  RUBIO 10  BUSH 7  Wow, how will the media put a negative spin on this one?
10/21/2015 10:41:40	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @GMA Good Morning America at 7:00 A.M. @ABC will be announcing new poll numbers. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
10/21/2015 10:36:45	Twitter for Android	Just out: Boston Herald/Franklin Pierce Poll  N.H.  TRUMP 28 (up 10)  CARSON 16  BUSH 9  RUBIO 6  CRUZ 5  Press will say they are surging!

10/21/2015 2:49:08	Twitter for Android	.@MonicaCrowley you were GREAT on @seanhannity tonight. Thank you for the nice words!
10/21/2015 2:46:47	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @GMA Good Morning America tomorrow at 7:00 A.M. Big new ABC poll coming out - I hope I do well!
10/21/2015 0:58:34	Twitter for Android	.@seanhannity at 10:00.
10/21/2015 0:21:43	Twitter for Android	.@KarlRove  Had my best day ever in the polls, one had me at 41% - Morning Consult. Boston Globe, Monmouth, NBC and CNN all great. More!
10/21/2015 0:05:13	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10:00. You will find it very interesting (I hope). Enjoy!
10/20/2015 19:27:29	Twitter Web Client	I will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10 PM @FoxNews. #Hannity
10/19/2015 13:36:31	Twitter for Android	Jeb is fighting to defend a catastrophic event. I am fighting to make sure it doesn't happen again.Jeb is too soft-we need tougher &amp; sharper
10/19/2015 13:30:30	Twitter for Android	It's really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming!
10/18/2015 21:27:58	Twitter for Android	Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace will be re-broadcast on @FoxNews  at 6:00 P.M.
10/18/2015 18:15:24	Twitter for Android	It's amazing that some of the dumbest people on television work for the Wall Street Journal, in particular a real dope named Charles Lane!
10/18/2015 18:00:53	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace at 2:00 P.M. on @FoxNews - Turn off the football for 15 minutes, Make America Great Again!
10/18/2015 16:15:19	Twitter for Android	Replay of Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace at 2:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Big statement made by Chris!
10/18/2015 15:41:51	Twitter for Android	I should release the sad and totally apologetic letter that Penn @pennjillette hand delivered to me. Minds would be changed very fast!
10/18/2015 15:14:11	Twitter for Android	.@MittRomney and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost!
10/18/2015 15:06:21	Twitter for Android	.@MittRomney  can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible "choke" loss to Obama!
10/18/2015 13:53:48	Twitter for Android	.@FoxNewsSunday
10/18/2015 13:29:03	Twitter for Android	Jeb, why did your brother attack and destabalize the Middle East by attacking Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction? Bad info?
10/18/2015 13:09:48	Twitter for Android	This morning Chris Wallace has the best political show on television - but that's only because I'm on it (kidding)! Have fun.
10/18/2015 13:04:36	Twitter for Android	Jeb Bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them. Also, Rubio is hitting him hard!
10/18/2015 12:59:20	Twitter for Android	On at 9:00A.M. or 10:00 A.M. (depending on your location)  on Fox is a tough but really good interview with Chris Wallace. Enjoy!
10/17/2015 23:43:04	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace at 9:00 A.M. or 10:00 A.M. (depending on location). Will be tough but good!
10/17/2015 3:49:19	Twitter for Android	.@KatrinaPierson, you did a fantastic job tonight on @FoxNews. Thank you for your very tough and very smart representation!
10/16/2015 12:57:25	Twitter for Android	.@scottienhughes  Keep up the great work Scottie. Polls are best ever!
10/16/2015 2:22:29	Twitter for Android	Every poll, Time, Drudge, Slate and others, said I won both debates - but heard Megyn Kelly had her two puppets say bad stuff. I don't watch
10/16/2015 2:12:26	Twitter for Android	.@marcthiessen is a failed Bush speechwriter whose work was so bad that he has never been able to make a comeback. A third rate talent!
10/16/2015 2:00:12	Twitter for Android	Megyn Kelly has two really dumb puppets, Chris Stirewalt &amp; Marc Threaten (a Bushy) who do exactly what she says. All polls say I won debates
10/15/2015 19:56:30	Twitter Web Client	Will be on @bloombergtv tomorrow with @sruhle. Enjoy!
10/15/2015 18:45:35	Twitter Web Client	Why is the @GOP being asked to do a debate that is so much longer than the just-aired and very boring #DemDebate?
10/15/2015 18:44:47	Twitter Web Client	.@CNBC is pushing the @GOP around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials.
10/15/2015 18:44:04	Twitter Web Client	The @GOP should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @CNBC is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party.
10/15/2015 18:33:07	Twitter Web Client	.@KevinHart4real joined @woodmank104 @katek104 @K1047 &amp; was asked about his thoughts on @realDonaldTrump #Trump2016 Thanks Kevin--so nice!
10/14/2015 18:47:23	Twitter Web Client	.@andersoncooper did an excellent job of hosting the #DemDebate last night. Tough, firm, but fair.
10/14/2015 18:18:18	Twitter Web Client	Steven Tyler got more publicity on his song request than he’s gotten in ten years. Good for him!
10/14/2015 18:18:07	Twitter Web Client	Even though I have the legal right to use Steven Tyler’s song, he asked me not to. Have better one to take its place!
10/14/2015 17:27:50	Twitter for Android	Will be going to Richmond, Virginia today. Big crowd! See you there.
10/14/2015 16:31:34	Twitter Web Client	The debate last night proved that Hillary is running against the “B” team. She won’t be so lucky when it comes to me!
10/14/2015 14:57:25	Twitter Web Client	#DemDebate was really boring but had a lot of fun live tweeting and picked up by far the most followers.
10/14/2015 14:55:58	Twitter Web Client	Like her or not, Hillary did what she had to do in the debate last night—get through it. Her opponents were very gentle and soft!
10/14/2015 2:56:33	Twitter for Android	Check out OAN and compare to what you are watching now!
10/14/2015 2:33:13	Twitter for Android	Notice that illegal immigrants will be given ObamaCare and free college tuition but nothing has been mentioned about our VETERANS #DemDebate
10/14/2015 2:15:50	Twitter for Android	Sanders said only black lives matter - wow! Hillary did not answer question!
10/14/2015 2:02:02	Twitter for Android	Sorry, there is no STAR on the stage tonight!
10/14/2015 1:55:31	Twitter for Android	Good move by Bernie S.
10/14/2015 1:54:05	Twitter for Android	The hardest thing Clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including Iraq vote, e-mails etc.
10/14/2015 1:48:30	Twitter for Android	All are very scripted and rehearsed, two (at least) should not be on the stage.
10/14/2015 1:33:46	Twitter for Android	Who is winning the debate so far (just last name)? #DemDebate
10/14/2015 1:11:14	Twitter for Android	O'Malley, as former Mayor of Baltimore, has very little chance.
10/14/2015 1:08:59	Twitter for Android	Can anyone imagine Chafee as president? No way.
10/14/2015 1:03:37	Twitter Web Client	The trade deal is a disaster, she was always for it! #DemDebate
10/14/2015 0:08:14	Twitter for Android	Should be interesting but too bad the three guys at《1% will be taking up so much time -  but who knows, maybe a star will be born (unlikely)
10/13/2015 15:52:02	Twitter Web Client	How can Jeb Bush expect to deal with China, Russia + Iran if he gets caught doing a “plant” during my speech yesterday in NH?
10/13/2015 15:09:24	Twitter Web Client	Everybody's talking about my doing twitter during the likely very boring debate tonight. @realDonaldTrump #DemDebate
10/13/2015 11:39:52	Twitter for Android	The arrogant young woman who questioned me in such a nasty fashion at No Labels yesterday was a Jeb staffer! HOW CAN HE BEAT RUSSIA &amp; CHINA?
10/13/2015 10:46:46	Twitter for Android	Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!
10/13/2015 9:49:36	Twitter for Android	Someone should inform @CNN that, despite spending millions of $'s on graphics, it is not the Democratic Debate, rather the Democrat (s) D!
10/13/2015 9:43:56	Twitter for Android	At the request of many, and even though I expect it to be a very boring two hours, I will be covering the Democrat Debate live on twitter!
10/12/2015 16:25:38	Twitter for Android	Leaving soon after a great time in New Hampshire, a truly special place!
10/12/2015 1:52:15	Twitter for Android	Great, everyone is saying I did much better on @60Minutes  last week than President Obama did tonight. I agree!
10/12/2015 1:43:08	Twitter for Android	President Obama was terrible on @60Minutes tonight. He said CLIMATE CHANGE is the most important thing, not all of the current disasters!
10/11/2015 12:09:52	Twitter for Android	I will be on Face The Nation (CBS) today at 10:30 A.M. and Media Buzz (Fox News) at 11:00 A.M. Enjoy!

10/10/2015 21:36:52	Twitter for Android	Little Barry Diller, who lost a fortune on Newsweek and Daily Beast, only writes badly about me. He is a sad and pathetic figure. Lives lie!
10/10/2015 13:47:54	Twitter for Android	I'm leading big in every poll and we are going to WIN! Remember, Trump NEVER gives up!
10/10/2015 13:31:55	Twitter for Android	Paul Ryan is far from my first choice, but a very nice guy. The Republicans should go for tough and (very) smart this time - no games!
10/10/2015 2:17:46	Twitter for Android	Heading for Atlanta tomorrow morning for noon speech at North Atlanta Trade Center. Big crowds, great people!

10/9/2015 22:43:35	Twitter Web Client	Great Gravis Poll on the great state of NH. Also, watch @FaceTheNation on CBS &amp; @HowardKurtz #mediabuzz -- both on Sunday.
10/9/2015 19:42:29	Twitter Web Client	@michaeljohns With this month's 224-page @simonschuster book Crippled America, Trump has most specific policy agenda of any candidate..
10/9/2015 19:28:14	Twitter Web Client	@JayMichaelsProd  Trump won the crowd yesterday curious to see how many are changing their registrations from Democrat to Republican??
10/9/2015 17:44:21	Twitter Web Client	I will be interviewed on @FacetheNation Sunday 10AM on CBS. @johndickerson is a true pro!
10/9/2015 10:52:55	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:20. Great crowd in Las Vegas yesterday!
10/8/2015 16:46:37	Twitter for Android	Washington (D.C.) is such a mess - nothing works! I will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  It's not going to happen with anyone else.
10/8/2015 16:31:33	Twitter for Android	Great, Kevin McCarthy drops out of SPEAKER race. We need a really smart and really tough person to take over this very  important job!
10/8/2015 16:12:07	Twitter Web Client	I'm at Trump Int'l Hotel in Las Vegas, tallest/most beautiful building in town. Speaking to another great crowd at Treasure Island (12 noon)
10/8/2015 16:01:02	Twitter Web Client	What a time we all had in Iowa yesterday, massive overflow crowd. Love them!
10/8/2015 15:57:09	Twitter Web Client	Wow, great news! I hear @EWErickson of Red State was fired like a dog. If you read his tweets, you'll understand why. Just doesn't have IT!
10/8/2015 15:45:06	Twitter Web Client	I hear @glennbeck is in big trouble. Unlike me, his viewers &amp; ratings are way down &amp; he has become irrelevant—glad I didn’t do his show.
10/8/2015 15:44:04	Twitter Web Client	Wacky @glennbeck who always seems to be crying (worse than Boehner) speaks badly of me only because I refuse to do his show--a real nut job!
10/7/2015 23:51:36	Twitter for Android	Just arrived in Las Vegas for a packed house speech tomorrow. Big poll results today, Leading big everywhere. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
10/7/2015 23:17:34	Twitter for Android	Iowa was amazing today. Great crowd, great people. Thanks, will be back soon!
10/7/2015 23:05:05	Twitter for Android	.@stuartpstevens made some of the dumbest political decisions of all time in helping Romney to get destroyed by Obama. Should have won!
10/7/2015 15:47:34	Twitter Web Client	.@politico has no power,  but so dishonest!
10/7/2015 15:46:52	Twitter Web Client	I wonder why somebody doesn't do something about the clowns @politico and their totally dishonest reporting.
10/7/2015 14:39:29	Twitter Web Client	Heading to a packed house in Waterloo, Iowa! Will celebrate today's great poll numbers together. See you soon!
10/7/2015 14:34:04	Twitter for Android	If Stuart Stevens' book is as bad as his horrible political advice to Mitt Romney, don't waste your money. Arrogant guy but a zero!
10/7/2015 11:51:38	Twitter for Android	Ben Carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman, and was not criticizing the victims. Not fair!
10/6/2015 15:16:47	Twitter Web Client	Crooked @club4growth has given up advertising in Iowa on me—remember they wanted my million dollars—I said no—total frauds!
10/6/2015 15:03:07	Twitter Web Client	.@WayneNewtonMrLV  Wayne, such a pleasant surprise--so nice. Thank you very much.
10/6/2015 1:57:19	Twitter for Android	Don't ever forget, we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
10/6/2015 0:06:16	Twitter for Android	So, so, so important - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
10/5/2015 23:40:16	Twitter for Android	Political strategist Stuart Stevens,who led Romney down the tubes in what should have been an easy victory,has terrible political instincts!
10/5/2015 21:12:45	Twitter Web Client	Thoughts and prayers for those in the floods affecting the great people of South Carolina.
10/5/2015 20:46:08	Twitter Web Client	The incompetence of our current administration is beyond comprehension. TPP is a terrible deal.
10/5/2015 4:29:56	Twitter for Android	For all of my fantastic  supporters, and for the U.S.A., we are going to win and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe greater than ever before!
10/4/2015 13:26:07	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed by @chucktodd on @meetthepress at 10:30 A.M.
10/4/2015 13:23:59	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed by @GStephanopoulos on @ABC    at 10:00 A.M.
10/3/2015 11:21:38	Twitter for Android	Rubio was very disloyal to Bush, his mentor, when he decided to run against him. Both said they "love" each other.They don't - word is hate!
10/3/2015 11:16:43	Twitter for Android	Bush and Rubio are finally attacking each other, as I knew they would, in order to be the last "establishment" man standing against me.Great
10/3/2015 2:51:08	Twitter for Android	Thank you @megynkelly for the nice things you said about Melania. You will like her, great heart and smart - always wanting to help people!
10/2/2015 13:22:40	Twitter for Android	Will be in Nashville, Tennessee, tomorrow (Saturday) at 2:30 P.M. So much to talk about - see you there!
10/2/2015 13:18:57	Twitter for Android	I was so looking forward to being in Virginia Beach, Virginia, today. The demand for tickets was amazing. Good luck with storm, back soon!
10/2/2015 0:41:22	Twitter for Android	My warmest condolences to the families of the horrible Roseburg, Oregon, shootings.
10/1/2015 19:15:57	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney is trying to hit back at me because I'm saying that he let the Repub Party down w/ his loss to Obama. Should've won—he choked!
10/1/2015 3:06:21	Twitter for Android	Just got back from New Hampshire. Great crowd, great people! Will be back soon!
9/30/2015 20:53:06	Twitter Web Client	I will be interviewed by @donlemon tonight on @CNN at 10PM.
9/30/2015 12:20:21	Twitter for Android	Rubio is totally owned by the lobbyists and special interests. A lightweight senator with the worst voting record in Senate. Lazy!
9/30/2015 11:51:35	Twitter for Android	Just read that "Trump" has the largest (and I add most enthusiastic) crowds. Tonight I will be in New Hampshire - the place will be packed!
9/30/2015 11:24:13	Twitter for Android	I watched lightweight Senator  Marco Rubio, who is all talk and no action, defend his WEAK position on illegal immigration. Pathetic!
9/29/2015 16:49:40	Twitter Web Client	Carl Icahn said this about me:  "I think at this moment in time, he’s the only candidate that speaks out about the country’s problems."
9/29/2015 15:04:30	Twitter Web Client	I hope when Rand Paul gets out of the race—he is at 1%--his supporters come over to me. I will do a much better job for them.
9/29/2015 15:04:21	Twitter Web Client	Prediction: Rand Paul has been driven out of the race by my statements about him-- he will announce soon. 1%!
9/28/2015 23:53:17	Twitter for Android	Do you believe this - Iran wants to trade our 3 prisoners (not 4) for 19 prisoners held by the U.S. Should have been let go with last deal!
9/28/2015 19:01:00	Twitter Web Client	Will be doing @OutFrontCNN with @ErinBurnett tonight at 7 pm re: tax reductions and various other topics.
9/26/2015 23:25:43	Twitter for Android	Hope we all enjoy  @60Minutes tomorrow night. I do believe they will treat me fairly!
9/26/2015 13:12:32	Twitter for Android	Marco Rubio is a member of the Gang Of Eight or, very weak on stopping illegal immigration. Only changed when poll numbers crashed.
9/25/2015 18:10:08	Twitter for Android	I am now inspecting the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue - will be a great hotel. Soon off to the Oklahoma State Fair!
9/25/2015 3:55:24	Twitter for Android	.@megynkelly, the @FoxNews   poll said very plainly I came in second in the debate. All others, Time, Drudge, Slate etc. said I came in 1st.
9/25/2015 3:23:51	Twitter for Android	Just watched @marcorubio on television. Just another all talk, no action, politician. Truly doesn't have a clue! Worst voting record in Sen.
9/24/2015 16:24:35	Twitter Web Client	Despite the establishment and the media’s best efforts, the people are speaking loudly and clearly. Thank you to my amazing supporters!
9/24/2015 14:46:26	Twitter Web Client	So happy about my daughter @IvankaTrump’s announcement that she will be having a baby this spring. Congratulations!
9/24/2015 10:03:26	Twitter for Android	Will be on @Morning_Joe at 6:30 A.M.
9/24/2015 10:01:40	Twitter for Android	Will be on @CNN at 7:00 A.M.
9/23/2015 16:02:53	Twitter Web Client	.@FoxNews has been treating me very unfairly &amp; I have therefore decided that I won't be doing any more Fox shows for the foreseeable future.
9/23/2015 15:12:18	Twitter Web Client	Headline reads" Rubio passes Bush in Florida poll" -- Unfair, because Trump destroys them both! Trump 31.5%, Rubio 19.2%, Bush 11.3%
9/23/2015 13:53:54	Twitter Web Client	.@JuliInkster  Congratulations on your great win--what a captain, what a champion!
9/23/2015 2:31:34	Twitter for Android	I will be the featured guest on the season opener of  @60Minutes this Sunday. There certainly is plenty to talk about!
9/23/2015 2:16:44	Twitter for Android	Just remember, the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!
9/23/2015 2:07:58	Twitter for Android	I think @megynkelly should take another eleven day "unscheduled" vacation.
9/23/2015 2:00:20	Twitter for Android	Do you ever notice that lightweight @megynkelly constantly goes after me but when I hit back it is totally  sexist. She is highly overrated!
9/23/2015 1:46:13	Twitter for Android	Senator Marco "amnesty" Rubio, who has worst voting record in Senate, just hit me on national security-but I said don't go into Iraq. VISION
9/22/2015 20:48:55	Twitter Web Client	Yom Kippur blessings to all of my friends in Israel and around the world. #YomKippur
9/22/2015 12:59:53	Twitter for Android	2016 Republican Primary Morning Consult Poll was just released. TRUMP 32, CARSON 12, BUSH 11, FIORINA 6, RUBIO 5, CRUZ 5. Taken after debate
9/22/2015 2:22:27	Twitter for Android	.@RichLowry is truly one of the dumbest of the talking  heads - he doesn't have a clue!
9/22/2015 2:00:26	Twitter for Android	I am having a really hard time watching @FoxNews.
9/22/2015 0:55:55	Twitter for Android	.@oreillyfactor, why don't you have some knowledgeable talking heads on your show for a change instead of the same old Trump haters. Boring!
9/22/2015 0:49:48	Twitter for Android	.@oreillyfactor was very negative to me in refusing to to post the great polls that came out today including NBC. @FoxNews not good for me!
9/21/2015 14:03:44	Twitter Web Client	#AskTrump Send me your questions to answer live from @TwitterNYC later this afternoon.
9/21/2015 1:34:00	Twitter for Android	Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP, virtually destroying both companies, that she never got another CEO job offer! Pres.
9/21/2015 0:59:16	Twitter for Android	We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe better than ever before!
9/21/2015 0:56:52	Twitter for Android	I am attracting the biggest crowds, by far, and the best poll numbers, also by far.   Much of the media is totally dishonest. So sad!
9/21/2015 0:51:49	Twitter for Android	I have been leading big in all  polls, with two more today, @nbc and @CNN. The NBC poll is more than double next,  at 29%. Fiorina has 11%.
9/21/2015 0:30:07	Twitter for Android	There is no way that Carly  Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!
9/20/2015 13:17:28	Twitter for Android	I will be on @meetthepress at 10:30. @nbc will be releasing their new poll numbers. Based on the debate results, I should do well-who knows?
9/19/2015 19:15:11	Twitter for Android	On my way to Iowa. Will be landing in Des Moines in two hours. See ya!
9/19/2015 13:37:14	Twitter for Android	Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great
9/19/2015 13:19:25	Twitter for Android	If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!
9/19/2015 12:58:08	Twitter for Android	If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!
9/19/2015 12:52:27	Twitter for Android	This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.
9/19/2015 12:45:57	Twitter for Android	Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!
9/18/2015 19:08:48	Twitter Web Client	GIVE AMERICA BACK ITS DREAM!    -- Donald J. Trump
9/17/2015 19:40:49	Twitter Web Client	Would be really bad if columnist Mike Lupica left the @NYDailyNews.  A wonderful and talented guy!
9/17/2015 19:33:12	Twitter Web Client	Will be interviewed tonight by @seanhannity on @FoxNews at 10 PM. Enjoy!
9/17/2015 17:28:58	Twitter Web Client	Going to New Hampshire in a little while. Big crowds! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
9/17/2015 17:18:22	Twitter Web Client	Every poll done on debate last night, from Drudge to Newsmax to Time Magazine, had me winning in a landslide. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
9/17/2015 17:17:03	Twitter Web Client	Just announced that in the history of @CNN, last night’s debate was its highest rated ever. Will they send me flowers &amp; a thank you note?
9/16/2015 20:32:19	Twitter for Android	Thank you to Tom Brady, Coach Ditka, Coach Bobby Knight and all of the many champions that have been so supportive!
9/16/2015 20:03:56	Twitter for Android	Will be heading over to the debate soon. Can you believe @CNN is "milking" it for almost 3 hours? Too long, too many people on stage!
9/16/2015 3:18:05	Twitter for Android	I hope Arnold S. does well with the Apprentice because he is a nice guy and also, because I get a big percentage of the profits!
9/16/2015 2:39:02	Twitter for Android	Just finished the wonderful event on the U.S.S. Iowa. VETERANS FOR A STRONG AMERICA endorsed me. Such a great honor, thank you!
9/15/2015 18:39:28	Twitter Web Client	.@rushlimbaugh Rush, I am in LA inspecting property (big job creator) &amp; listening to you. You are truly fantastic--thanks!
9/15/2015 18:00:34	Twitter Web Client	The polls are really looking good—#1 everywhere despite all lobbyist &amp; special interest $ being spent against me. I’m turning down millions.
9/15/2015 17:53:03	Twitter Web Client	Everyone is talking about the incredible event we had in Dallas last night. Spectacular crowd &amp; arena! Thank you @mcuban.
9/15/2015 17:47:53	Twitter Web Client	.@club4growth asked me for $1 million. I said no. Now falsely advertising that I will raise taxes. I’ll lower big league for middle class.
9/15/2015 17:46:43	Twitter Web Client	My plan will lower taxes for our country, not raise them. Phony @club4growth says I will raise taxes—just another lie.
9/15/2015 15:15:27	Twitter for Android	Little respected Club For Growth asked me for $1,000,000 - I said "NO". Now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads!
9/15/2015 14:59:33	Twitter for Android	Am now in L.A. Will be going to the U.S.S. IOWA at 5:30 P.M. to speak to our great VETERANS and other friends!
9/15/2015 14:39:52	Twitter Web Client	Our vets are treated like 3rd class citizens. Enough! Join me &amp; @V4SA on @USSIOWA at LA Waterfront to hear my plan for vets &amp; the military!
9/15/2015 14:31:58	Twitter for Android	Loved Dallas and the tremendous crowd last night. Will be back!
9/15/2015 4:56:50	Twitter for Android	Speech in Dallas went really well. Big and wonderful crowd. Just arrived in L.A. Big day tomorrow!
9/14/2015 18:23:39	Twitter Web Client	My opponents big bosses--lobbyists and donors--are trying to do damage. They will fail! Money down the drain!
9/14/2015 16:39:55	Twitter Web Client	To all my fans, sorry I couldn’t do The Apprentice any longer—but equal time (presidential run) prohibits me from doing so. Love!
9/14/2015 16:39:14	Twitter Web Client	Congrats to my friend @Schwarzenegger who is doing next season’s  Celebrity Apprentice. He'll be great &amp; will raise lots of $ for charity.
9/13/2015 13:41:32	Twitter for Android	Why is someone like George Pataki, who did a terrible job as Governor of N.Y. and registers ZERO in the polls, allowed on the debate stage?
9/12/2015 11:25:58	Twitter for Android	Will be on @foxandfriends at 8:00. Enjoy!
9/11/2015 22:58:27	Twitter for Android	The Tonight Show @nbc will be amazing - 11:30 P.M.  ENJOY!
9/11/2015 17:24:44	Twitter Web Client	.@robertjeffress I greatly appreciate your kind words last night on @FoxNews. Have great love for the evangelicals -- great respect for you.
9/11/2015 15:31:05	Twitter Web Client	Just purchased NBC’s half of The Miss Universe Organization and settled all lawsuits against them. Now own 100% -- stay tuned!
9/11/2015 15:19:03	Twitter Web Client	Let’s all take a moment to remember all of the heroes from a very tragic day that we cannot let happen again!
9/11/2015 13:12:09	Twitter Web Client	Oh wow, lightweight Governor @BobbyJindal, who is registered at less than 1 percent in the polls, just mocked my hair. So original!
9/11/2015 12:49:53	Twitter Web Client	Also, tomorrow night I will be going to Boone and Ames. Really look forward to seeing all of my friends in Iowa.
9/11/2015 12:49:20	Twitter Web Client	Very good news—the new Quinnipiac poll just came out—I am #1 in Iowa.
9/11/2015 12:42:00	Twitter Web Client	I will be on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon tonight at 11:30. Should be fun! @jimmyfallon
9/10/2015 21:11:26	Twitter Web Client	.... I only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls. I never thought he had a chance and I’ve been proven right.
9/10/2015 21:11:06	Twitter Web Client	Bobby Jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore I have never met him….
9/10/2015 17:58:06	Twitter Web Client	I'll be on @greta ON THE RECORD tonight at 7 PM
9/10/2015 0:42:58	Twitter for Android	Wow, I am ahead of the field with Evangelicals (am so proud of this) and virtually every other group, and Ben Carson just took a swipe at me
9/10/2015 0:29:20	Twitter for Android	I had a great day in D.C. even though the subject was an unpleasant one, the horrible Iran Nuke deal. Amazing crowd and enthusiasm!
9/9/2015 19:46:28	Twitter Web Client	Man did JEB throw his brother under the bus last night on @colbertlateshow . Probably true, but not nice!
9/9/2015 3:23:25	Twitter for Android	See you in D.C. tomorrow at 1:00 P.M. at the Capitol to protest the horribly negotiated deal with Iran. Really sad!
9/8/2015 21:47:40	Twitter Web Client	Will be on Bill O'Reilly @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM. Enjoy!
9/8/2015 19:57:05	Twitter Web Client	I'm on Bill @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM. It will be another lively interview about how to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
9/8/2015 19:44:50	Twitter Web Client	Jeb’s policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse. Right after he left he went to work for Lehman Brothers—wow!
9/8/2015 19:41:52	Twitter Web Client	The lobbyists &amp; special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me "just a little" but is very false!
9/8/2015 19:41:18	Twitter Web Client	I’m self funding my campaign but lobbyists &amp; special interests for Jeb &amp; others are starting to do big ads—desperate! Don’t believe them.
9/8/2015 17:43:32	Twitter Web Client	Thank you @IngrahamAngle for your strength &amp; wonderful words last night on @FoxNews, but @KarlRove is easy to beat!
9/8/2015 15:24:48	Twitter Web Client	Tomorrow in DC: 1 PM West Front Lawn of the Capitol. Not even believable that we would do this deal with Iran.
9/8/2015 15:22:51	Twitter Web Client	Look forward to being in DC tomorrow—big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with Iran.
9/7/2015 20:25:19	Twitter for Android	Looking forward to being with @SenTedCruz at our big rally in D.C. on Wednesday (1:00 P.M. at the Capitol) to protest insane Iran nuke deal!
9/7/2015 19:35:32	Twitter for Android	Both Washington D.C. and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events. D.C. is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech!
9/7/2015 19:29:48	Twitter for Android	Remember, I'll see you in D.C. at the Capitol Building on Wednesday at 1:00 o'clock. Then Dallas on Sept.14 at 6:00 P.M. American Air Center
9/7/2015 19:04:56	Twitter for Android	Thank you @scottienhughes for your powerful words on @FoxNews. I am with the Evangelicals and Tea Party big time. We will all WIN  together!
9/7/2015 0:28:21	Twitter for Android	.@club4growth should release the letter they sent me asking for $1,000,000. When I said no, they came out against me. A scam operation?
9/6/2015 20:37:32	Twitter for Android	I will be in Washington D.C. on Wednesday,1 P.M.,in front of the Capitol, to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with Iran.
9/6/2015 20:28:01	Twitter for Android	The Dallas event on September 14 at 6:00 P.M. at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success. Tickets are going FAST!
9/6/2015 20:24:00	Twitter for Android	Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision, not someone like Hillary or Barack, neither of which has a clue!
9/6/2015 20:11:43	Twitter for Android	The phony Club For Growth, which asked me in writing for $1,000,000 (I said no), is now wanting to do negative ads on me. Total hypocrites!
9/5/2015 21:54:41	Twitter for Android	The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP. They are paying practically nothing. We must reduce taxes for the middle class!
9/5/2015 21:50:25	Twitter for Android	By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!
9/5/2015 21:46:47	Twitter for Android	Remember that I am self-funding my campaign. Hillary, Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% CONTROLLED
9/5/2015 21:42:32	Twitter for Android	Hillary said such nasty things about me, read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion, no truth. Just can't read speeches!
9/5/2015 21:36:41	Twitter for Android	Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen. In fact, it wasn't even see through glass, it was black
9/5/2015 21:33:28	Twitter for Android	Saudi Arabia was "vehemently" against the Iran nuclear deal. Then today they embraced it. What happened? What did we give them to endorse?
9/5/2015 12:28:21	Twitter for Android	Just announced that because of "Trump", advertising rates for debate on @CNN are going from $5000 to $200,000, a 4000% increase.PAY CHARITY?
9/5/2015 12:20:39	Twitter for Android	Why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like Hugh Hewitt be doing the next debate on @CNN. He is just a 3rd rate "gotcha" guy!
9/5/2015 12:14:11	Twitter for Android	Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman, Abu Bake al-Baghdad, Hassan Nasrallah and more - typical "gotcha" questions
9/5/2015 12:05:31	Twitter for Android	The Dallas event in two weeks, at the American Airlines Center, is filling up fast. Get your tickets fast,  before it is too late!
9/5/2015 11:56:51	Twitter for Android	.@MeghanMcCain was terrible on @TheFive yesterday. Angry and obnoxious, she will never make it on T.V. @FoxNews can do so much better!
9/4/2015 10:54:59	Twitter for Android	Will be on @Morning_Joe in 5 minutes - at 7:00. Enjoy!
9/3/2015 16:49:11	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to Tom Brady on yet another great victory- Tom is my friend and a total winner!
9/3/2015 2:35:23	Twitter for Android	The deal with Iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made. The U.S. lost on virtually every point. We just don't win anymore!
9/3/2015 2:04:12	Twitter for Android	.@brithume, I am in first place by a lot in all polls, tied for first place with Ben Carson in one Iowa poll. I thought you knew this-thanks
9/2/2015 19:20:21	Twitter Web Client	.@kevinolearytv Great job on @foxandfriends this morning. You tell it like it is! Also, thx for the nice mention. Your book sounds great!
9/2/2015 10:24:39	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed on @GMA this morning at 7:00. Thanks for the GREAT poll results!
9/2/2015 2:15:06	Twitter for Android	When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1,000,000, they got nasty.What a waste of money that would have been
9/2/2015 2:05:52	Twitter for Android	The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C. and asked for a ridiculous $1,000,000 contribution. I said no way!
9/2/2015 1:35:02	Twitter for Android	Every Poll has me winning BIG.If you listen to dopey Karl Rove, a Trump hater, on @oreillyfactor, you would think I'm doing poorly. @FoxNews
9/2/2015 0:49:55	Twitter for Android	Why does @oreillyfactor and @FoxNews always have Karl Rove on. He spent $430 million and lost ALL races. A dope who said Romney won election
9/1/2015 20:07:25	Twitter Web Client	I’m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions—feel totally stupid doing so, but hope it is appreciated by the voters.
9/1/2015 20:05:31	Twitter Web Client	Many Super Pacs, funded by groups that want total control over their candidate, are being formed to “attack” Trump. Remember when u see them
9/1/2015 18:41:08	Twitter Web Client	Congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on Twitter--and heading up fast!
9/1/2015 15:57:20	Twitter Web Client	While millions are being spent against me in attack ads, they are paid for by the “bosses” and “owners” of candidates. I am self funding.
9/1/2015 15:56:44	Twitter Web Client	Jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists &amp; special interests. Bad system.
9/1/2015 15:56:32	Twitter Web Client	Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?
9/1/2015 2:05:32	Twitter for Android	Just out - new PPP NATIONAL POLL has me in first place by a wide margin at 29%. I wonder why only @FoxNews has not reported this? Too bad!
9/1/2015 0:43:46	Twitter for Android	150 Clinton E-mails still contain classified information. More sensitive when she was Sec.of State. This is a very big deal.
9/1/2015 0:38:17	Twitter for Android	President Obama wants to change the name of Mt. McKinley to Denali after more than 100 years. Great insult to Ohio. I will change back!
8/31/2015 15:05:50	Twitter Web Client	For those that don’t think a wall (fence) works, why don’t they suggest taking down the fence around the White House? Foolish people!
8/31/2015 11:52:44	Twitter for Android	Huma Abedin, the top aide to Hillary Clinton and the wife of perv sleazebag Anthony Wiener, was a major security risk as a collector of info
8/31/2015 10:33:10	Twitter for Android	Leading in the Bloomberg Iowa poll. Also, my favorability numbers went up at a record, almost unheard of, clip. Thank you Iowa!
8/31/2015 10:27:56	Twitter for Android	Loved being with my many friends in Tennessee. The crowd and enthusiasm was fantastic. I won the straw poll big!
8/29/2015 12:45:55	Twitter for Android	Wow, Jeb Bush just lost three of his top fundraisers - they quit!
8/29/2015 12:43:35	Twitter for Android	Leaving now for Tennessee. Big crowd!
8/29/2015 12:40:29	Twitter for Android	Great rally last night in Massachusetts. 2000 people at a house - must be a record! Unbelievable spirit to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
8/28/2015 1:51:13	Twitter for Android	Great job tonight on @FoxNews Tony. I am with you all the way! Make America Great Again  @tperkins
8/28/2015 0:18:39	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:00 A.M. So much to talk about!
8/27/2015 22:27:58	Twitter Web Client	Who wants the endorsement of a guy (@EricCantor) who lost in perhaps the greatest upset in the history of Congress?
8/27/2015 14:24:04	Twitter Web Client	.@BenFergusonShow just watched you on @CNN. Thank you for your nice comments.
8/27/2015 3:22:31	Twitter for Android	Great job on @CNN tonight @heytana. We are all proud of you! Also, congrats on a great son - he is going places.

8/26/2015 18:08:06	Twitter Web Client	.@DennisDMZ Thanks for the nice words. You are fantastic!
8/26/2015 4:38:46	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow this morning at 7:00. Talking about politics, polls and whatever. Enjoy!
8/26/2015 4:34:51	Twitter for Android	Just got back from Iowa. Fantastic evening with truly fabulous people. Will be back again soon. Thanks!
8/25/2015 20:07:35	Twitter for Android	Heading to Iowa to a packed house. Just released polls, all first place, are amazing. Thank you!
8/25/2015 13:49:59	Twitter Web Client	Congrats @LindseyGrahamSC. You just got 4 points in your home state of SC—far better than zero nationally. You’re only 26 pts behind me.
8/25/2015 10:52:28	Twitter for Android	Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. A mess!
8/25/2015 10:49:06	Twitter for Android	In a clumsy move to get out of his "anchor babies" dilemma, where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it, he blamed ASIANS
8/25/2015 2:57:09	Twitter for Android	Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising, signage, materials etc. Is he ashamed of the name BUSH? A pretty sad situation. Go Jeb!
8/25/2015 1:50:30	Twitter for Android	I liked The Kelly File much better without @megynkelly. Perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation!
8/25/2015 1:42:42	Twitter for Android	.@megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation, she is really off her game. Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration!
8/24/2015 13:43:13	Twitter for Android	Markets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda. This could get very messy! Vote Trump.
8/24/2015 13:30:48	Twitter for Android	As I have long stated, we are so tied in with China and Asia that their markets are now taking the U.S. market down. Get smart U.S.A.
8/23/2015 11:01:19	Twitter for Android	New Reuters Poll just came out and has me at 32%, highest number yet.The silent majority is back and we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
8/23/2015 10:39:52	Twitter for Android	The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House. Would be the same old thing (remember "read my lips, no more taxes"). GREATNESS!
8/22/2015 22:27:37	Twitter for Android	Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. Jeb just can't get it right!
8/22/2015 22:19:05	Twitter for Android	Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration, in favor of common core, bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing.
8/22/2015 21:22:03	Twitter for Android	Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border, most other candidates are finally  speaking up. Just politicians!
8/22/2015 20:28:50	Twitter for Android	It has just been confirmed by  the City of Mobile, Alabama, that there were 30,000 people at last nights event, making it  #1for pol season.
8/22/2015 20:23:47	Twitter for Android	How is Bernie Sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone? Very sad!
8/22/2015 20:18:59	Twitter for Android	Thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive  story on my speech in Alabama last night. It was a great evening!
8/22/2015 20:13:21	Twitter for Android	I had 15,000 people in Phoenix but @politico said "the rooms capacity is just over 2000." But said Bernie  Sanders had 11,000 in same room.
8/22/2015 19:44:38	Twitter for Android	.@politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source, and that is saying something. They go out of their way to distort truth!
8/22/2015 11:58:08	Twitter for Android	Alabama was great last night, amazing people. 30,000 folks  was largest crowd of political season. Nice!
8/21/2015 20:06:26	Twitter for Android	Dow dives more than 500 points - down 9% from high. Be careful!
8/21/2015 20:01:32	Twitter for Android	Leaving for Mobile, Alabama, right now - can't be late!
8/21/2015 16:35:21	Twitter Web Client	Boston incident is terrible. We need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect. I would never condone violence.
8/21/2015 13:56:00	Twitter for Android	How crazy - 7.5% of all births in U.S. are to illegal immigrants, over 300,000 babies per year. This must stop. Unaffordable and not right!
8/21/2015 13:49:56	Twitter for Android	Jeb Bush signed memo saying not to use the term "anchor babies," offensive. Now he wants to use it because I use it. Stay true to yourself!
8/21/2015 5:03:29	Twitter for Android	Alabama will shine tomorrow. It will be a big and glorious day!
8/21/2015 4:57:55	Twitter for Android	We are going to make our country so strong again, so great again. No more ripping off the United States. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
8/21/2015 4:38:51	Twitter for Android	.@TomLlamasABC cannot report the news truthfully. Why not apologize for your fraudulent story on World News Tonight.Gang members &amp; criminals
8/21/2015 4:04:52	Twitter for Android	@ABCPolitics must apologize. My statement "we're going to get them out so fast, so quick" applied to hard core criminals &amp; gang members. LIE
8/19/2015 2:18:46	Twitter for Android	I am looking forward to being in New Hampshire tomorrow. The silent majority is taking our country back. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
8/18/2015 20:52:54	Twitter Web Client	@ktumulty Polls indicate that a Trump presidency is now inevitable. #August
8/18/2015 20:39:18	Twitter Web Client	If I am elected President I will immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline.  No impact on environment &amp; lots of jobs for U.S.
8/18/2015 20:17:56	Twitter Web Client	.@jasondhorowitz  I am very proud of my sister, your story was terrific. Thank you so much.
8/18/2015 17:42:49	Twitter Web Client	When foreigners attend our great colleges &amp; want to stay in the U.S., they should not be thrown out of our country.
8/18/2015 17:42:13	Twitter Web Client	I want talented people to come into this country—to work hard and to become citizens. Silicon Valley needs engineers, etc.
8/17/2015 18:13:15	Twitter Web Client	Listening to @rushlimbaugh on way back to Jury Duty. Fantastic show, terrific guy!
8/17/2015 18:13:11	Twitter for Android	Why does @FoxNews keep George Will as a talking head? Wrong on so many subjects!
8/15/2015 22:09:24	Twitter for Android	Just got back from the Iowa State Fair. Record crowds, phenomenal people. Thank you IOWA, I will never let you down!
8/15/2015 13:17:12	Twitter for Android	In the plane heading to Iowa State Fair. Will be great fun. Hopefully giving helicopter rides to some of the kids.
8/14/2015 21:02:23	Twitter for Android	Making speech tonight in New Hampshire - leaving now. Fantastic people, fantastic crowd!
8/13/2015 20:55:01	Twitter Web Client	.@AP and @HuffingtonPost should change their fraudulent story to say THAT I DROPPED @NBC &amp; The Apprentice to run for President!
8/13/2015 20:15:19	Twitter Web Client	People don’t understand that I left The Apprentice to run for Pres—the Apprentice DID NOT leave me. Bob Greenblatt &amp; folks @NBC were GREAT!
8/11/2015 19:17:15	Twitter Web Client	The #IranDeal is a catastrophe that must be stopped. Will lead to at least partial world destruction &amp; make Iran a force like never before.
8/11/2015 18:24:52	Twitter Web Client	@mikerotondo86 Only Trump can bring us back from 20 Trillion in debt... He's the only one with the experience and skill set to do so.
8/11/2015 17:29:32	Twitter Web Client	Will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight for the full hour. Hope you enjoy it and, more importantly, hope you agree!
8/11/2015 2:36:26	Twitter for Android	.@SenTedCruz had a very good debate, far better than Rand Paul.
8/11/2015 1:18:23	Twitter for Android	.@ericbolling you can do much better than you did tonight on @oreillyfactor. Better luck tomorrow!
8/11/2015 1:03:56	Twitter for Android	Why is @RandPaul allowed to take advantage of the people of Kentucky by running for Senator and Pres. Why should Kentucky be back up plan?
8/11/2015 0:58:57	Twitter for Android	We must stop the crime and killing machine that is illegal immigration. Rampant problems will only get worse. Take back our country!
8/11/2015 0:41:58	Twitter for Android	Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE!
8/11/2015 0:29:16	Twitter for Android	Again, illegal immigrant is charged with the fatal  bludgeoning of a wonderful and loved 64 year old woman. Get them out and build a WALL!
8/10/2015 20:09:57	Twitter Web Client	.@KatrinaCampins Thank you so much for the wonderful statements you made about me on TV. Also, keep up the great work!
8/10/2015 20:09:27	Twitter Web Client	.@BrandenRoderick I was pleased to see the wonderful statements you made about me to the media.I'm not surprised, you're a special person
8/10/2015 18:25:27	Twitter Web Client	.@OMAROSA You were fantastic on television this weekend. Thank you so much – you are a loyal friend!
8/10/2015 15:35:38	Twitter Web Client	Roger Ailes just called. He is a great guy &amp; assures me that “Trump” will be treated fairly on @FoxNews. His word is always good!
8/10/2015 9:29:19	Twitter for Android	.@KathieLGifford, Melania  and I send our deepest condolences. Frank was a special and amazing person. He will be missed by all!
8/10/2015 9:20:55	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @TODAY Show at 7:00 A.M. and on Morning Joe at 7:20.
8/9/2015 20:36:27	Twitter for Android	Wonderful Frank Gifford has just passed away at age 84. He was my friend and a truly great guy! Warmest condolences to family.
8/9/2015 19:42:34	Twitter for Android	It amazes me that other  networks seem to treat me so much better than @FoxNews. I brought them the biggest ratings in history, &amp; I get zip!
8/9/2015 19:06:21	Twitter for Android	I just realized that if you listen to Carly Fiorina for more than ten minutes straight, you develop a massive headache. She has zero chance!
8/9/2015 3:45:40	Twitter for Android	Small crowds at @RedState today in Atlanta. People were very angry at EWErickson, a major sleaze and buffoon who has saved me time and money
8/8/2015 20:40:17	Twitter for Android	Almost universal support that "Trump won the debate." Only @FoxNews is consistantly fighting the Trump win, and I got them the ratings!
8/8/2015 19:38:59	Twitter for Android	Wow, CNN just said that Donald Trump won the DEBATE, connected best with audience. Also, Time, Drudge, Newsmax, N.Y.Times and more!
8/8/2015 12:46:18	Twitter for Android	Re Megyn Kelly quote: "you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever" (NOSE). Just got on w/thought
8/8/2015 12:29:09	Twitter for Android	So many "politically correct" fools in our country. We have to all get back to work and stop wasting time and energy on nonsense!
8/7/2015 20:36:56	Twitter Web Client	The hatred that clown @krauthammer has for me is unbelievable – causes him to lie when many others say Trump easily won debate.
8/7/2015 20:35:32	Twitter Web Client	....Dopey @krauthammer should be fired. @FoxNews
8/7/2015 20:35:08	Twitter Web Client	.@FoxNews you should be ashamed of yourself. I got you the highest debate ratings in your history &amp; you say nothing but bad...
8/7/2015 7:53:46	Twitter for Android	I really enjoyed the debate tonight even though the @FoxNews trio, especially @megynkelly, was not very good or professional!
8/7/2015 7:45:18	Twitter for Android	.@FrankLuntz, your so-called "focus groups" are a total joke. Don't come to my office looking for business again. You are a clown!
8/7/2015 7:40:41	Twitter for Android	Wow, @megynkelly really bombed tonight. People are going wild on twitter! Funny to watch.
8/7/2015 7:37:32	Twitter for Android	.@FrankLuntz I won every poll of the debate tonight by massive margins @DRUDGE_REPORT &amp; @TIME  so where did you find that dumb panel.
8/7/2015 7:28:40	Twitter for Android	.@FrankLuntz is a low class slob who came to my office looking for consulting work and I had zero interest. Now he picks anti-Trump panels!
8/6/2015 14:31:57	Twitter Web Client	I look forward to tonight's "debate" -- but look far more forward to making America great again. It can happen!
8/6/2015 14:26:21	Twitter Web Client	.@realbobmassi, who does a show called "Bob Massi Is The Property Man" on @FoxNews, really knows his stuff--a total pro!
8/5/2015 21:16:41	Twitter Web Client	AmyMek  Amen! @realDonaldTrump has drawn more attention to Veterans issues in 1 week than these politicians have in decades!
8/5/2015 16:06:51	Twitter Web Client	@JoeDurak If Jeb is the nominee Hillary is our next president.
8/5/2015 15:38:35	Twitter Web Client	@tweet2u2 #Trump only attacks those that attack him first. He's not going to be abused by a  #politician @marthamaccallum #tcot
8/5/2015 14:37:31	Twitter Web Client	Do you notice that Hillary spews out Jeb's name as often as possible in order to give him status? She knows Trump is her worst nightmare.
8/5/2015 14:37:04	Twitter Web Client	Many of Hillary’s donors are the same donors as Jeb Bush’s—all rich, will have total control—know them well.
8/4/2015 21:19:56	Twitter Web Client	I will be on @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 8 PM and 11 PM.
8/4/2015 15:38:25	Twitter Web Client	Thank you @gawker! Call me on my cellphone 917.756.8000 and listen to my campaign message.

8/3/2015 20:31:13	Twitter Web Client	We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.  --  Albert Einstein
8/3/2015 15:50:33	Twitter Web Client	It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary’s private illegal emails. Huma’s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world.
8/3/2015 15:42:43	Twitter Web Client	.@Jrprotalker Thanks Judy for the wonderful statements on @TrumpTurnberry. Great seeing you there &amp; you did a fabulous job on commentary.
8/3/2015 15:41:57	Twitter Web Client	.@DottieandBogey Thanks for nice comments over weekend re Turnberry. You and your husband have fantastic taste! Also, great commentary.
8/3/2015 15:33:44	Twitter Web Client	Despite the false @nytimes story about Jeb Bush being happy with the Trump surge, he fell more than anybody &amp; is miserable.
8/3/2015 15:33:34	Twitter Web Client	Wow, did the @nytimes fall into the Bush trap where his people convinced them how happy he was that I was hurting other candidates &amp; not him
8/3/2015 9:58:59	Twitter for Android	Bush is pretending that the "Trump surge" is great for him and the @nytimesworld is  reporting Bush "delight" - con job, a Bush nightmare!
8/3/2015 3:23:45	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 7:00. Enjoy!
8/2/2015 14:00:16	Twitter for Android	I wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers. Puppets?
7/31/2015 19:20:50	Twitter Web Client	@blindtothetruth Trump is polling well because he speaks his mind. Not like some of the career politicians he's running against. Cowards.
7/31/2015 13:54:06	Twitter Web Client	If you think you can do a thing or think you can't do a thing, you're right. -- Henry Ford
7/31/2015 13:40:04	Twitter Web Client	Wow, some new and even greater polls--thank you!
7/31/2015 13:39:08	Twitter Web Client	Will be leaving Trump Turnberry tomorrow--place &amp; Women's British Open are great. Will be back hitting hard tomorrow. @Turnberrybuzz
7/31/2015 13:36:33	Twitter Web Client	Should not raise taxes in Wisconsin, but massive budget deficit. Education, roads, etc suffering. @DanHenninger lies. @WSJ
7/30/2015 20:27:42	Twitter Web Client	The polls have been consistently great. The silent majority is speaking. Politicians are failing. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
7/30/2015 19:46:37	Twitter Web Client	I look forward to the debate on Thursday night &amp; it is certainly my intention to be very nice &amp; highly respectful of the other candidates.
7/30/2015 19:39:29	Twitter Web Client	Just at a news conference from Trump Turnberry in Scotland. Everybody was there &amp; will be all over television tonite. Back on trail Saturday
7/30/2015 19:36:36	Twitter Web Client	Carl Cameron @FoxNews is the only reporter I know who consistently fumbles &amp; misrepresents poll results. He has been so wrong &amp; he hates it!
7/30/2015 0:08:00	Twitter for Android	Getting ready to leave for my GREAT resort, Turnberry, in Scotland. Hosting The Women's British Open (biggest tournament). Will be back Sat.
7/30/2015 0:00:45	Twitter for Android	I really like the Koch Brothers (members of my P.B. Club), but I don't want their money or anything else from them. Cannot influence Trump!
7/29/2015 21:45:13	Twitter Web Client	People like lawyer Elizabeth Beck and failed writer Harry Hurt &amp; others talk about me but know nothing about me—crazy!
7/29/2015 21:44:56	Twitter Web Client	How can a dummy dope like Harry Hurt, who wrote a failed book about me but doesn’t know me or anything about me, be on TV discussing Trump?
7/29/2015 21:15:54	Twitter Web Client	Trump Will Make America GREAT!!!!  #ChangeTheWorldIn5Words
7/29/2015 20:54:56	Twitter Web Client	... while Tom Brady is guilty because he REPLACED his LEGAL cellphone?
7/29/2015 20:54:45	Twitter Web Client	Per @rushlimbaugh: Why does Hillary Clinton get the benefit of the doubt (after she DESTROYS her illegal email server) ...
7/29/2015 13:58:36	Twitter for Android	I truly LOVE all of the millions of people who are sticking with me despite so many media lies. There is a great SILENT MAJORITY looming!
7/29/2015 13:54:28	Twitter for Android	Thank you @Morning_Joe for throwing the pathetic reporter from the failing and money losing Daily Beast off the air. Really cool!
7/29/2015 12:56:35	Twitter for Android	So many people who know nothing about me are commenting all over T.V. and the media as though they have great D.J.T. insight. Know NOTHING!
7/29/2015 12:44:59	Twitter for Android	.@CNN  Why is somebody (Beck) I beat so soundly all of a sudden an expert on Donald Trump (all over television). She knows nothing about me.
7/29/2015 12:40:14	Twitter for Android	.CNN &amp; @CNNPolitics  Lawyer Elizabeth Beck did a terrible job against me, she lost (I even got legal fees). I loved beating her,she was easy
7/29/2015 12:32:53	Twitter for Android	Lawyer Elizabeth Beck was easy for me to beat. Ask her clients if they are happy with her results against me. Got total win and legal fees.
7/29/2015 12:28:24	Twitter for Android	.@CNN &amp; @CNNPolitics did not say that lawyer Beck lost the case and I got legal fees. Also, she wanted to breast pump in front of me at dep.

7/28/2015 19:00:35	Twitter Web Client	Obama’s nuclear deal with the Iranians will lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. It has to be stopped.
7/28/2015 17:17:26	Twitter Web Client	.#IranDeal will go down as one of the dumbest &amp; most dangerous misjudgments ever entered into in history of our country—incompetent leader!

7/27/2015 21:13:12	Twitter Web Client	@AmyMek The Media hates Trump b/c he's a Proud American Entrepreneur who loves his country, wants others 2 succeed &amp; calls out their lies
7/27/2015 20:23:18	Twitter Web Client	@ScoodieGolden Twitter loves Trump. 1000's of retweets for Mr. Trump while @ScottWalker gets 5 to 10 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
7/27/2015 19:50:26	Twitter Web Client	Veterans, please call 855- VETS- 352 or email address veterans@donaldtrump.com to share your stories about the need to reform the VA.
7/27/2015 18:51:17	Twitter Web Client	.@SteveRattner While I think you should have gone to prison for what you did, I guess Obama saved you. But watch – I will win!
7/27/2015 18:33:28	Twitter Web Client	@Cj112Connie I don't get the media??Trump is ahead in every poll, but won't give him credit, they say he won't make it?? 60% of us say yes
7/27/2015 18:01:15	Twitter Web Client	When people find out how bad a job Scott Walker has done in WI, they won’t be voting for him. Massive deficit, bad jobs forecast, a mess.
7/27/2015 17:35:14	Twitter Web Client	Great news, I’m now leading in most polls w/ new CNN poll also having me #1. NBC, I am #1 in NH by a lot, #2 in Iowa, close &amp; gaining.
7/26/2015 2:19:49	Twitter for Android	.@ScottWalker is a nice guy, but not presidential material. Wisconsin is in turmoil, borrowing to the hilt, and doing poorly in jobs etc.
7/26/2015 1:11:23	Twitter for BlackBerry	Great success in Iowa today. Fantastic sold out crowd. Will be back soon!
7/25/2015 16:59:49	Twitter for BlackBerry	.@ScottWalker despite your coming to my office to give me an award, your very dumb fundraiser hit me very hard--- not smart!
7/25/2015 16:14:59	Twitter for BlackBerry	.@ShawnJohnson Congratulations on your engagement --- he is a lucky guy. You are  a true winner and will be an amazing couple.
7/25/2015 15:52:24	Twitter Web Client	.@Macy’s is a big contributor to @PPFA . Anybody against Planned Parenthood should boycott racial profiling Macy’s.
7/25/2015 13:33:56	Twitter for Android	Isn't it funny that I am now #1 in the money losing @HuffingtonPost (poll), and by a big margin. Dummy @ariannahuff must be thrilled!
7/25/2015 13:16:32	Twitter for Android	The ultra liberal and seriously failing Des Moines Register is BEGGING my team for press credentials to my event in Iowa today-but they lie!
7/25/2015 12:09:05	Twitter for Android	Big poll just out by @TheEconomist has me in 1st. place by a lot. A great honor but we have a long way to go to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

7/24/2015 20:46:59	Twitter Web Client	Isn’t it amazing that @Macys paid a massive fine for profiling African Americans--&amp; then criticized me for discussing illegal immigration!
7/24/2015 19:46:11	Twitter Web Client	.@marklevinshow has written a great book, Plunder and Deceit. He powerfully analyzes issues that are crucial to us today. Read it!
7/24/2015 18:35:48	Twitter Web Client	@paulkellysr  Mr Trump thanks for saying what millions are thinking. We need to turn America around if we want to save her.
7/24/2015 18:32:21	Twitter Web Client	@gpavlik7  1/2 of new California driver’s licenses go to undocumented immigrants. Read the Sac' Bee, July 17th. Go get'em, Trump!

7/24/2015 16:43:23	Twitter Web Client	When will anyone be held accountable for the VA scandal? The politicians are experts in never facing any consequence.
7/24/2015 16:35:30	Twitter Web Client	.@williebosshog watched you on @foxandfriends. You were great and I appreciate the nice statements. I’m sending out for your new book now!

7/23/2015 13:07:34	Twitter for Android	.@BillKristol   Bill, your small and slightly failing magazine will be a giant success when you finally back Trump. Country will soar!
7/23/2015 10:36:53	Twitter for Android	What a waste of time being interviewed by @andersoncooper when he puts on really stupid talking heads likeTim O'Brien-dumb guy with no clue!
7/23/2015 2:57:01	Twitter for Android	Boycott @Macys, no guts, no glory. Besides, there are far better stores!
7/23/2015 2:47:26	Twitter for Android	.@AC360  Has the absolutely worst anti-Trump talking heads on his show. Dopey writer O'brian knows nothing about me or my wealth. A waste!
7/23/2015 2:30:15	Twitter for Android	.@tedcruz you were terrific on @seanhannity tonight. I am going to the border tomorrow.
7/23/2015 2:14:12	Twitter for Android	.@FrankLuntz knows nothing about me or my religion. Came to my office looking for work. I had NO interest. I will save the vets!
7/22/2015 18:39:45	Twitter Web Client	Shouldn’t George Will have to give a disclaimer every time he is on Fox that his wife works for Scott Walker?
7/22/2015 17:56:26	Twitter Web Client	Will be interviewed by @andersoncooper on @CNN tonight. Let’s see if he treats me fairly—enjoy!
7/22/2015 17:43:53	Twitter Web Client	Obama still will keep all military recruitment centers &amp; bases Gun Free Zones! It has to stop. MILITARY LIVES MATTER!
7/22/2015 14:59:02	Twitter Web Client	Thank you @chucktodd for your commentary last night on @NBCNightlyNews. Very fair -- we are making progress together!
7/22/2015 14:31:54	Twitter Web Client	I'm going to the BORDER tomorrow. Will be seeing some really brave people. Look forward to a big day!
7/22/2015 0:53:41	Twitter for Android	I hear a failing New York newspaper is going to publish one of my old cell phone numbers. So original - just one of many!
7/21/2015 18:33:33	Twitter for BlackBerry	I'm glad President Obama followed my lead and lowered the flags half-staff. It's about time!
7/21/2015 15:00:13	Twitter Web Client	.@ZachJohnsonPGA  You're one of the truly great competitiors. I’ve said it for years. Great going winning @OpenChampionship - Not surprised!
7/21/2015 14:30:52	Twitter for BlackBerry	Rick Perry did an absolutely horrible job of securing the border. He should be ashamed of himself. Gov. Abbott has since been terrific.
7/21/2015 14:14:53	Twitter for BlackBerry	Good luck to my new friends on your testimony in DC. You are amazing people doing something so important--- stopping illegal immigration!
7/21/2015 14:11:42	Twitter Web Client	@DillyDoesIt Trump has no problem telling it how it is, isn't that what everyone has been wanting from a President? #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
7/21/2015 11:55:43	Twitter for Android	Just got great national poll numbers - double digit lead!  Thank you, we will all MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
7/21/2015 5:30:52	Twitter for Android	Wow, new @ABCnews/@WashingtonPost @GOP preference poll has DonaldTrump 11 points up! Thank you.
7/20/2015 23:27:55	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00. Will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans, illegal immigration, etc.
7/20/2015 20:24:14	Twitter Web Client	Look how small the pages have become @WSJ. Looks like a tabloid—saving money I assume!
7/20/2015 16:46:38	Twitter Web Client	This story is no longer about John McCain, it’s about our horribly treated vets. Illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans.
7/20/2015 16:41:40	Twitter Web Client	It was only after I informed NBC that I wouldn't do the Apprentice that they became upset w/ me. They couldn’t care less about “inclusion"
7/20/2015 15:51:51	Twitter Web Client	@RTMatador Trump says things that no one else would even consider saying, I agree with him on the immigration situation, i love honesty
7/20/2015 15:45:04	Twitter Web Client	@_EOD  I believe we have passed that point. There are Homeless Veterans in USA &amp; yet Illegal Aliens get Government Housing
7/20/2015 15:10:41	Twitter Web Client	@johnjcarp61  At least we're talking about the #VA! We weren't a month ago! @realDonaldTrump @JohnMcCain
7/20/2015 14:25:52	Twitter Web Client	We will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans.
7/20/2015 14:25:14	Twitter Web Client	The ever dwindling @WSJ which is worth about 1/10 of what it was purchased for, is always hitting me politically. Who cares!
7/19/2015 21:06:45	Twitter for Android	I will be making some very big campaign stops next week - big crowds and tremendous  energy!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
7/19/2015 21:03:06	Twitter for Android	The Republican Party must get tougher and smarter, and fast, or it will go down to a very big defeat - just like the last two times!
7/19/2015 10:22:11	Twitter for Android	The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly. John McCain has done nothing to help them but talk.
7/19/2015 10:15:50	Twitter for Android	John McCain called thousands of people "crazies" when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix. He owes apology!
7/18/2015 23:18:24	Twitter Web Client	One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians. I will fix VA quickly.
7/18/2015 20:46:53	Twitter Web Client	Why would anybody listen to @MittRomney? He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama. By the way,so did John McCain!
7/18/2015 20:18:21	Twitter Web Client	Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas, @GregAbbott_TX, for taking a tough &amp; bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry.
7/18/2015 18:51:48	Twitter for BlackBerry	I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept.
7/18/2015 18:16:32	Twitter Web Client	....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
7/18/2015 18:16:26	Twitter Web Client	It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans.....
7/18/2015 18:15:49	Twitter Web Client	I will make this right for our great Vets!
7/18/2015 18:15:36	Twitter Web Client	All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything.
7/18/2015 18:15:19	Twitter Web Client	....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives.
7/18/2015 18:15:12	Twitter Web Client	The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years...
7/18/2015 17:59:29	Twitter Web Client	Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes!
7/18/2015 17:59:14	Twitter Web Client	In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!
7/18/2015 17:58:56	Twitter Web Client	Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. I will be back soon.
7/18/2015 14:09:25	Twitter for Android	I am now in Iowa getting ready to speak. People are always amazed to find out that I am Protestant (Presbyterian). GREAT.
7/18/2015 14:03:49	Twitter for Android	The $10 billion (net worth) is AFTER all debt and liabilities. So simple to understand but @CNN &amp; @CNNPolitics is just plain dumb!
7/18/2015 13:57:21	Twitter for Android	Ratings starved @CNN and @CNNPolitics does not cover me accurately. Why can't they get it right - it's really not that hard!
7/18/2015 13:49:36	Twitter for Android	Made a speech in Arkansas last night before a record GOP crowd. Great spirit and amazing people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
7/18/2015 13:44:28	Twitter for Android	It's driving @ariannahuff &amp; the money losing @HuffingtonPost post crazy that I am #1 in their poll and they only write bad stories about me!
7/18/2015 13:37:55	Twitter for Android	The liberal clown  @ariannahuff told her minions at the money losing @HuffingtonPost to cover me as enterainment. I am #1 in Huff Post Poll.
7/18/2015 2:20:31	Twitter for BlackBerry	.@genesimmons really great job handling the wise guys --- so easy for you--- such talent! I won’t forget.
7/17/2015 17:31:57	Twitter Web Client	MILITARY LIVES MATTER! END GUN FREE ZONES! OUR SOLDIERS MUST BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES! THIS HAS TO STOP!
7/17/2015 17:31:19	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to speaking at the @ARGOP Reagan-Rockefeller Dinner tonight! Record crowd. We are no longer silent! #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!
7/17/2015 9:44:29	Twitter for Android	Get rid of gun free zones. The four great marines who were just shot never had a chance. They were highly trained but helpless without guns.
7/16/2015 21:02:38	Twitter Web Client	Thoughts and prayers to the families of the four great Marines killed today.
7/16/2015 20:49:34	Twitter Web Client	.@GovernorPerry failed on the border. He should be forced to take an IQ test before being allowed to enter the GOP debate.
7/16/2015 20:48:19	Twitter Web Client	.@GovernorPerry just gave a pollster quote on me. He doesn't understand what the word demagoguery means.
7/16/2015 20:39:56	Twitter Web Client	.@SenJohnMcCain should be defeated in the primaries. Graduated last in his class at Annapolis--dummy!
7/16/2015 20:38:16	Twitter Web Client	The thousands of people that showed up for me in Phoenix were amazing Americans. @SenJohnMcCain called them "crazies"--must apologize!
7/16/2015 20:02:34	Twitter Web Client	Leaving for New Hampshire now. Making a speech—packed house.  Love it!
7/16/2015 19:57:10	Twitter Web Client	The Iran deal poses a direct national security threat. It must be stopped in Congress. Stand up Republicans!
7/16/2015 19:54:31	Twitter Web Client	The worst show in Las Vegas, in my opinion, is @pennjillette. Hokey garbage. New York show even worse!
7/16/2015 19:49:24	Twitter Web Client	Dopey @Lawrence O’Donnell, whose unwatchable show is dying in the ratings, said that my Apprentice $ numbers were wrong. He is a fool!
7/16/2015 19:20:45	Twitter Web Client	No deal is better than a bad deal. America out negotiated again.  #Iran
7/16/2015 17:52:21	Twitter Web Client	@danforc  as a legal immigrant I'm so glad someone standing up for us, the millions who do things by the book to earn our place here Thx
7/16/2015 15:02:34	Twitter Web Client	.@KarlRove wasted $400 million + and didn’t win one race—a total loser. @FoxNews
7/16/2015 15:02:03	Twitter Web Client	.@FoxNews You shouldn’t have @KarlRove on the air—he’s a clown with zero credibility—a Bushy!
7/16/2015 14:46:22	Twitter Web Client	.@BradSteinle Great talking to you and your parents—fantastic people. Keep your sister’s very important memory alive—big impact!
7/16/2015 14:02:01	Twitter Web Client	.@andydean2014 Thank you, you were great. You can defend me anytime. Amazing job.
7/16/2015 13:14:15	Twitter for Android	I hope the boycott of @Macys continues forever. So many people are cutting up their cards. Macy's stores suck and they are bad for U.S.A.
7/16/2015 13:10:00	Twitter for Android	I loved firing goofball atheist Penn @pennjillette on The Apprentice. He never had a chance. Wrote letter to me begging for forgiveness.
7/16/2015 10:18:31	Twitter for Android	I hear @pennjillette show on Broadway is terrible. Not surprised, boring guy (Penn). Without The Apprentice,  show would have died long ago.
7/16/2015 10:10:17	Twitter for Android	Irrelevant clown @KarlRove sweats and shakes nervously on @FoxNews as he talks "bull" about me. Has zero cred. Made fool of himself in '12.
7/15/2015 21:02:41	Twitter Web Client	@UncleLouie Clearly Trump gets social media. His tweets are everywhere &amp; no sugar coating, he keeps it real. Wish all candidates did that
7/15/2015 20:52:23	Twitter Web Client	@ReevesMH  it's been a long time since I've been excited about a candidate. How refreshing to have a bold voice. Go Trump!
7/15/2015 20:01:56	Twitter Web Client	.@StephenBaldwin7 You were fabulous on CNN last night--I greatly appreciate your support.  Best wishes.
7/15/2015 15:01:52	Twitter Web Client	.@FoxNews should not put @KarlRove on—he has no credibility, a bush plant who called all races wrong.
7/15/2015 15:01:37	Twitter Web Client	Why do people listen to clown @KarlRove on @FoxNews? Spent $430M &amp; lost all races—a Bushy!
7/15/2015 14:50:16	Twitter Web Client	.@BradSteinle Thank you for yr wonderful tweet of July 4. I wanted a little time to go by before calling. Your sister &amp; family are amazing.

7/14/2015 13:23:46	Twitter Web Client	Matt Harvey @Mets -- Don't let the @NYDailyNews get you down---nobody reads it. Play well.

7/13/2015 16:21:40	Twitter Web Client	Mexico’s totally corrupt gov’t looks horrible with El Chapo’s escape—totally corrupt. U.S. paid them $3 billion.
7/13/2015 16:20:39	Twitter Web Client	The joke around town is that I freed El Chapo from the Mexican prison because the timing was so good w/ my statements on border security.
7/13/2015 16:14:16	Twitter Web Client	.@McLaughlinGroup Greatly appreciate yr wonderful comments this weekend. People of “great accomplishment” should easily quality for prez.
7/13/2015 16:14:01	Twitter Web Client	Isn’t it interesting that now that I’m #1 in the polls, the networks show polls that are a month old!
7/13/2015 10:59:19	Twitter for Android	When will people, and the media, start to apologize to me for my statement, "Mexico is sending....", which turned out to be true?  El Chapo
7/13/2015 10:53:14	Twitter for Android	....likewise, billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico    through the border. We get the killers, drugs &amp; crime, they get the money!
7/13/2015 10:47:36	Twitter for Android	El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a  vacuum cleaner, sucking drugs and death right into the U.S.
7/13/2015 4:05:42	Twitter for Android	The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our "leaders" can't say no!
7/13/2015 2:14:13	Twitter for Android	.....but that's what I've been saying. Very unfair treatment by the media!
7/13/2015 2:10:23	Twitter for Android	Now that the Mexican drug lord escaped from prison, everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc. coming into the U.S. comes over border!
7/13/2015 0:36:25	Twitter for Android	I hear that sleepy eyes @chucktodd will be fired like a dog from ratings starved Meet The Press? I can't imagine what is taking so long!
7/13/2015 0:29:05	Twitter for Android	...Trump, however, would kick his ass!
7/12/2015 13:21:24	Twitter for Android	Phoenix Convention Center officials did not want to have thousands of people standing outside in the heat, so they let them in. A GREAT day!
7/12/2015 13:18:21	Twitter for Android	Convention Center officials in Phoenix don't want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room.
7/11/2015 14:49:40	Twitter for Android	Getting ready to go to Las Vegas (Freedom Fest) - great crowd. Then on to amazing Phoenix - that will be a total happening! Love America.
7/11/2015 11:46:36	Twitter for Android	Boycott @Macys and @Univision. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
7/11/2015 11:44:39	Twitter for Android	Has anyone seen the financials of @Univision. They are doing really badly. Too much debt and not enough viewers. Need money fast. Funny!
7/10/2015 14:51:31	Twitter for BlackBerry	Jeb Bush just announced he raised over $100M. Everyone of those people who contributed are getting something to the detriment of America!
7/10/2015 14:04:49	Twitter Web Client	@kpmck63 Stay the course Mr. Trump! It's easier for others to attack you because you are saying the things that they won't. #Truth
7/10/2015 13:25:34	Twitter for Android	Iran continues to delay the nuclear deal while doing many bad things behind our backs. Time to WALK and double the sanctions. Stop payments!

7/9/2015 17:23:04	Twitter Web Client	@rdbrewer4 Trump: Keep throwing those giant hand grenades into the amnesty debate.  You're pissing off all the right people in the GOP.
7/9/2015 17:12:11	Twitter Web Client	Why does a failed magazine like @Forbes constantly seek out trivial nonsense? Their circulation way down. @Clare_OC
7/9/2015 17:11:40	Twitter Web Client	Dummy @Clare_OC @Forbes: Tiny fragrance deal with Parlux means nothing. Still sold at Trump Tower...
7/9/2015 17:11:06	Twitter Web Client	Dummy @Clare_OC from failing @Forbes magazine: NASCAR deal was 1 nite ballroom, ESPN was small golf outing...
7/9/2015 17:10:50	Twitter Web Client	Dummy writer @Clare_OC from failing @Forbes magazine works so hard to make such trivial license deals look important…
7/9/2015 16:36:24	Twitter Web Client	Watched chief negotiator for Iran on @charlierose last night. He is far smarter than our reps—increase sanctions and walk!
7/9/2015 13:25:11	Twitter Web Client	Totally false reporting on my call with @Reince Priebus. He called me, ten minutes, said I hit a “nerve", doing well, end!
7/8/2015 16:14:16	Twitter Web Client	@CaseyBierer America needs to hear the truth. Keep it up, Mr. Trump. You can help us make America great again. Never give up.

7/8/2015 11:22:53	Twitter for Android	I will be in California this weekend making a speech for Clint Eastwood. Then to Arizona and Vegas. Big crowds. Discussing illegals &amp; more!
7/7/2015 22:00:23	Twitter Web Client	Wow! I hear that thousands of people are cutting up their @Macys credit card. That's great. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
7/7/2015 15:35:14	Twitter Web Client	.@AnnCoulter U were great last nite @ericbolling on FOX. Our country has become a dumping ground for the world--I'll get it to stop &amp; fast!
7/7/2015 15:33:19	Twitter Web Client	People rarely say that many conservatives didn’t vote for Mitt Romney. If I can get them to vote for me, we win in a landslide.
7/7/2015 2:48:36	Twitter for Android	We have got to take our country back. It's time!
7/6/2015 19:14:43	Twitter Web Client	@absabella  Mr.Trump speaks the TRUTH And Will NOT Back Down!! That's why he will be our next President!! #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN
7/6/2015 17:14:42	Twitter Web Client	Thx to all the people who called to say they are cutting their @Macys credit card as a protest against illegal immigrants pouring into US
7/6/2015 0:47:54	Twitter for Android	I said simply that the Mexican leaders and negotiators are smarter than ours and that the Mexican gov't is pushing their hard core to U.S.
7/6/2015 0:27:15	Twitter for Android	Thank you @loudobbsnews, I will be trying very hard to prove you right - great show!
7/5/2015 15:02:22	Twitter Web Client	Jeb Bush will never secure our border or negotiate great trade deals for American workers. Jeb doesn't see &amp; can't solve the problems.
7/5/2015 14:51:42	Twitter Web Client	I appreciate the GOP candidates who remain strong on border security. They know I am right. A nation without borders cannot survive.
7/5/2015 14:44:31	Twitter Web Client	Rick Perry failed at the border. Now he is critical of me. He needs a new pair of glasses to see the crimes committed by illegal immigrants.
7/5/2015 8:57:17	Twitter for Android	Miss Universe, Paulina Vega, criticized me for telling the truth about illegal immigration, but then said she would keep the crown-Hypocrite
7/4/2015 22:28:56	Twitter for Android	Why would Republican candidates want the support of Mitt Romney. He lost an election against Obama that should NEVER have been lost!
7/4/2015 22:15:01	Twitter for Android	What about the undocumented immigrant with a record who killed the beautiful young women (in front of her father) in San Fran. Get smart!
7/4/2015 13:16:44	Twitter for Android	HAPPY 4TH OF JULY TO EVERYONE!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
7/4/2015 12:05:49	Twitter for Android	I will be on @foxandfriends this morning at 8:30. Enjoy!
7/3/2015 22:39:46	Twitter Web Client	My heartfelt condolences to the family of Kathryn Steinle. Very, very sad!
7/3/2015 16:18:55	Twitter Web Client	A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation. - President Ronald Reagan
7/3/2015 11:22:38	Twitter for Android	Wow, Huffington Post just stated that I am number 1 in the polls of Republican candidates. Thank you, but the work has just begun!
7/3/2015 11:09:51	Twitter for Android	Mexican leaders and negotiators are much tougher and smarter than those of the U.S. Mexico is killing us on jobs and trade. WAKE UP!
7/3/2015 4:19:53	Twitter for Android	As Governor of Texas, Rick Perry could have done far more to secure the border - but that's O.K., I like him anyway!  @GovernorPerry
7/2/2015 19:41:00	Twitter Web Client	Obama once again just missed a self-imposed deadline with Iran. Our leadership is weak &amp; ineffective. Double the sanctions!
7/2/2015 16:34:43	Twitter Web Client	@racheljoycowley I'm done with Macy's. Apparently, they follow the trend of trying to force legislation on every American freedom. Done!
7/2/2015 15:09:42	Twitter Web Client	Why doesn’t somebody study the horrible charges brought against @Macys for racial profiling? Terrible hypocrites!
7/2/2015 15:09:03	Twitter Web Client	.@Macys stock just dropped. Interesting. So many people calling to say they are cutting up their @Macys credit card. Thank you!
7/1/2015 21:11:30	Twitter Web Client	Who is @Macys to pretend innocence when they “racial profile” all over the place? Paid big fine!
7/1/2015 21:10:58	Twitter Web Client	Interesting that @Macys criticized me but just paid $650,000 in fines for racial profiling. Are they racists?
7/1/2015 21:09:53	Twitter Web Client	.@GovernorPataki  couldn’t be elected dog catcher if he ran again—so he didn’t!
7/1/2015 21:09:35	Twitter Web Client	.@GovernorPataki was a terrible governor of NY, one of the worst -- would’ve been swamped if he ran again!
7/1/2015 19:33:55	Twitter Web Client	.@andersoncooper  Anderson—Thank you for being so fair with your reporting &amp; story last night. Greatly appreciated!
7/1/2015 17:00:19	Twitter Web Client	For all of those who want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, boycott @Macys. They are weak on border security &amp; stopping illegal immigration.
7/1/2015 16:59:51	Twitter Web Client	Those who believe in tight border security, stopping illegal immigration &amp;  SMART trade deals w/other countries should boycott @Macys.
6/30/2015 22:52:18	Twitter Web Client	Get ready for @Oreillyfactor tonight at 8- always interesting!
6/30/2015 20:51:17	Twitter Web Client	Watch me on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8PM.
6/30/2015 16:32:57	Twitter Web Client	@yankeeworshiper  thank you to Donald Trump for standing up for what you believe in.leave the B.S.and lies for Hillary and Barack.
6/30/2015 12:57:28	Twitter for Android	I love the Mexican people, but Mexico is not our friend. They're killing us at the border and they're killing us on jobs and trade. FIGHT!
6/30/2015 12:35:44	Twitter for Android	We MUST have strong borders and stop illegal immigration. Without that we do not have a country. Also, Mexico is killing U.S. on trade. WIN!
6/29/2015 11:54:39	Twitter for Android	Remember, Univision apologized!
6/29/2015 11:40:38	Twitter for Android	Saudi Arabia should be paying the United States many billions of dollars for our defense of them. Without us, gone!  @AlWaleedbinT
6/28/2015 23:23:25	Twitter for Android	.@NYDailyNews, the dying tabloid owned by dopey clown Mort Zuckerman, puts me on the cover daily because I sell. My honor, but it is dead!
6/27/2015 14:52:12	Twitter for Android	When you are in a war, or even a battle, losing is not an option!
6/27/2015 14:50:19	Twitter for Android	When somebody challenges you unfairly, fight back - be brutal, be tough - don't take it. It is always important to WIN!
6/26/2015 16:38:33	Twitter Web Client	If I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts on ObamaCare.
6/26/2015 15:13:06	Twitter Web Client	.@Univision cares far more about Mexico than it does about the U.S.  Are they controlled by the Mexican government?
6/26/2015 14:07:44	Twitter Web Client	Anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the US should boycott @Univision.
6/26/2015 14:06:22	Twitter Web Client	Once again the Bush appointed  Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!
6/25/2015 14:27:45	Twitter Web Client	I love Mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the US so stupidly makes with them. Really bad for US jobs, only good for Mexico.
6/25/2015 14:27:20	Twitter Web Client	Univision wants to back out of signed @MissUniverse contract because I exposed the terrible trade deals that the U.S. makes with Mexico.
6/25/2015 14:26:52	Twitter Web Client	Mexican gov doesn't want me talking about terrible border situation &amp; horrible trade deals. Forcing Univision to get me to stop- no way!
6/25/2015 12:29:09	Twitter for Android	Governor Rick Scott of Florida did really poorly on television this morning. I hope he is O.K.
6/25/2015 12:19:39	Twitter for Android	I hear that dopey political pundit, Lawrence O'Donnell, one of the dumber people on television, is about to lose his show-no ratings?Too bad
6/25/2015 3:17:46	Twitter for Android	We have to bring back and cherish the middle class - once the backbone and true strength of the U.S.A. It can happen!
6/25/2015 2:16:38	Twitter for Android	My message, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, is beginning to take hold. Bring back our jobs, strengthen our military and borders, help our VETS!
6/25/2015 2:11:01	Twitter for Android	My daughter Ivanka did great tonight in New Hampshire. The sold out crowd loved her, and she loved them. Thanks Ivanka!
6/25/2015 2:07:53	Twitter for Android	.@WhoopiGoldberg had better surround herself with better hosts than Nicole Wallace, who doesn't have a clue. The show is close to death!
6/25/2015 1:55:14	Twitter for Android	The ratings for The View are really low. Nicole Wallace and Molly Sims are a disaster. Get new cast or just put it to  sleep. Dead T.V.
6/25/2015 1:00:32	Twitter for Android	I am really beginning to respect Mark Halperin and John Heilemann as political reporters - they truly get why "Trump" poll numbers are high.
6/25/2015 0:48:24	Twitter for Android	Just out, the new nationwide @FoxNews poll has me alone in 2nd place, closely behind Jeb Bush-but Bush will NEVER Make America Great Again!
6/25/2015 0:36:14	Twitter for Android	Uncomfortable looking NBC reporter Willie Geist calls me to ask for favors and then mockingly smiles when he is told of my high poll numbers
6/24/2015 21:04:19	Twitter Web Client	.@Neilyoung’s song, “Rockin’ In The Free World” was just one of 10 songs used as background music. Didn’t love it anyway.
6/24/2015 20:52:20	Twitter Web Client	.@Neilyoung A few months ago Neil Young came to my office looking for $$ on an audio deal &amp; called me last week to go to his concert. Wow!
6/24/2015 19:20:03	Twitter Web Client	My daughter, Ivanka, will be representing me today at the opening of our campaign office in Manchester, NH  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
6/24/2015 14:16:48	Twitter Web Client	Politician @SenatorCardin didn't like that I said Baltimore needs jobs &amp; spirit. It's politicians like Cardin that have destroyed Baltimore.
6/24/2015 12:12:37	Twitter for Android	The highly respected Suffolk University poll just announced that I am alone in 2nd place in New Hampshire, with Jeb Bust (Bush) in first.
6/23/2015 20:50:28	Twitter Web Client	@kolbytraveller #Trump is more than just talk. I hope he wins the election and gets something done for once in this country. #Trump2016
6/23/2015 13:35:48	Twitter Web Client	@williamonlyrent So sick of politicians sugar coating problems and issues. It will be so great to have #Trump2016 say it like it is!
6/22/2015 19:40:19	Twitter Web Client	.@DanaPerino  Have you released a copy of the beautiful thank you card you sent me? Would you like to see it? @ericbolling @kimguilfoyle
6/22/2015 19:03:04	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: Brainpower is the ultimate leverage. Don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities.

6/22/2015 14:55:10	Twitter Web Client	.@JordanSpieth  Great job--you are a true champion! See you soon.
6/22/2015 14:23:06	Twitter Web Client	@SovAdjEast  The USA is like Wollman Rink or Ferrypoint before DJT. You came you saw and built a masterpiece. Now it's the USA' s turn.

6/22/2015 10:39:21	Twitter for Android	I want to thank Elizabeth, Steve, Brian and all of the great folks of @foxandfriends for the long and successful run we had together. NICE!
6/22/2015 10:31:26	Twitter for Android	Sadly, I will no longer be doing @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. on Mondays. This is because I am running for president and law prohibits. LOVE!
6/22/2015 0:54:13	Twitter for Android	.@KarlRove still thinks Romney won! He doesn't have a clue! @FoxNews
6/22/2015 0:46:35	Twitter for Android	.@KarlRove stated clearly that he wants to repeal the 2nd Amendment. I thought @FoxNews was going to fire that jerk after his Romney fiasco?
6/21/2015 23:50:55	Twitter for Android	The great Mike Wallace covered me in a much more professional manner than his son, Chris Wallace of @FoxNews. Mike was a total pro!
6/21/2015 23:12:02	Twitter for Android	.@MarthaRaddatz was so unprofessional and biased when discussing me on This Week. @GStephanopoulos should not allow this conduct!
6/21/2015 22:28:29	Twitter for Android	.@KarlRove, who spent $430 million in the last cycle and didn't win one race, said I'm not a candidate until I file papers. Next week Karl!
6/21/2015 0:57:54	Twitter for Android	Who would you rather have negotiating for the U.S. against Putin, Iran, China, etc., Donald Trump or Hillary? Is there even a little doubt?
6/21/2015 0:25:21	Twitter for Android	Thank you @AnnCoulter for your nice words. The U.S. is becoming a dumping ground for the world. Pols don't get it. Make America Great Again!
6/20/2015 23:48:43	Twitter for Android	My speech is right now on C-SPAN 1
6/20/2015 2:22:29	Twitter for Android	Druggies, drug dealers, rapists and killers are coming across the southern border. When will the U.S. get smart and stop this travesty?
6/20/2015 1:54:25	Twitter for Android	Mexico is killing the United States economically because their leaders and negotiators are FAR smarter than ours. But nobody beats Trump!
6/20/2015 1:15:22	Twitter for Android	I like Mexico and love the spirit of  Mexican people, but we must protect our borders from people, from all over, pouring into the U.S.
6/20/2015 1:03:05	Twitter for Android	Why did @DanaPerino beg me for a tweet (endorsement) when her book was launched?
6/19/2015 20:31:45	Twitter Web Client	Our country is in a major crisis of incompetent leadership. We cannot continue to go on with these politicians who do nothing but talk.
6/19/2015 16:32:02	Twitter Web Client	Out of hundreds of deals &amp; transactions, I have used the bankruptcy laws a few times to make deals better. Nothing personal, just business.
6/19/2015 16:31:27	Twitter Web Client	Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool. Icahn, Black, Zell—but nobody says they went bankrupt!
6/19/2015 16:30:50	Twitter Web Client	People buy deals &amp; immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals. It’s a very effective &amp; commonly used business tool.
6/19/2015 16:30:25	Twitter Web Client	Stop saying I went bankrupt. I never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage—smart!
6/19/2015 14:35:44	Twitter Web Client	Has Charles @krauthammer ever apologized for being so totally wrong on Iraq? I called it right in every way—Make America Great Again!
6/19/2015 14:34:04	Twitter Web Client	George Will was a big Iraq fool.  $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost -- &amp; we got nothing! Dummy.
6/19/2015 14:27:59	Twitter Web Client	Goofy political pundit George Will spoke at Mar-a-Lago years ago. I didn’t attend because he’s boring &amp; often wrong—a total dope!
6/19/2015 13:41:05	Twitter Web Client	@llambert0207 I've always said the Country needs to be run like a Major Corporation it takes a Brilliant Businessman #power #donaldtrump
6/19/2015 13:04:01	Twitter Web Client	@theHickMan33 Let's get the Trump trending #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TheDonIsComing #TrumpCard #Vets4Trump
6/19/2015 12:56:36	Twitter Web Client	@williamonlyrent  Why is government run by politicians? It's a huge business and needs a businessman to run it successfully! #Trump2016
6/19/2015 12:53:20	Twitter Web Client	Just watched Brian Williams on @TODAYshow - very sad! Brian should get on with a new life and not start all over at @msnbc. Stop apologizing
6/18/2015 20:58:51	Twitter Web Client	@JustinBorges1 Trump 4 president...has a nice ring to it. About time someone who isn't afraid to say/do what's necessary took the reigns
6/18/2015 16:58:49	Twitter Web Client	The tragedy in South Carolina is incomprehensible. My deepest condolences to all.
6/17/2015 15:54:34	Twitter Web Client	Only a fool would buy the @NYDailyNews. Loses fortune &amp; has zero gravitas. Let it die!
6/17/2015 3:37:30	Twitter for BlackBerry	Enjoyed watching @MonicaCrowley's analysis of my @BillOreilly interview. Great points! Thank you, Monica.

6/7/2015 0:01:06	Twitter Web Client	Just received applause at #NCGOPcon when I said  "People ask me why I may run for President-- I might so we can Make America Great Again!
6/6/2015 23:56:27	Twitter Web Client	Just said at #NCGOPcon that "politicians are all talk and no action and we are all tired of it! We need action and results to move forward!"
6/6/2015 23:46:13	Twitter Web Client	Received a standing applause at #NCGOPcon when I said "to have free trade be fair for the US we need really intelligent negotiators."
6/6/2015 23:43:38	Twitter Web Client	Just Introduced at #NCGOPcon as the country's highest paid speaker. Told the record crowd of 650 I am to be speaking here for free!

6/5/2015 20:25:36	Twitter Web Client	We must stop Common Core from controlling state &amp; local curriculums. It is a federal grab of education. Keep education local!
6/5/2015 20:10:06	Twitter Web Client	China just hacked our federal government &amp; stole gov. workers’ information. Why do our leaders let China get away with this?! No respect.
6/5/2015 19:03:04	Twitter Web Client	.@GretchenCarlson's memoir is a powerful example of perseverance &amp; hope. “Getting Real” is as real as it gets. Get it &amp; enjoy! #GettingReal

6/5/2015 4:19:14	Twitter for Android	.@krauthammer pretends to be a smart guy, but if you look at his record, he isn't. A dummy who is on too many Fox shows. An overrated clown!
6/5/2015 3:55:04	Twitter for Android	One of the worst and most boring political pundits on television is @krauthammer. A totally overrated clown who speaks without knowing facts
6/4/2015 16:13:45	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: Vision remains vision until you focus, do the work, and bring it down to earth where it will do some good.
6/4/2015 16:10:14	Twitter Web Client	Re Negotiation: Think about what the other side wants. Know where they're coming from. View any conflict as an opportunity. Be flexible.

6/3/2015 19:36:10	Twitter Web Client	Just as I predicted, while Obama lifted sanctions 18 months ago, Iran cheated &amp; increased its nuclear fuel by 20%. We must DOUBLE sanctions!
6/3/2015 19:28:10	Twitter Web Client	Excited to be returning to the @NCGOP State Convention as the Keynote of Saturday’s dinner! @NCGOP is a strong Conservative state party!
6/3/2015 15:50:27	Twitter Web Client	The Trans-Pacific Partnership will increase our trade deficits &amp; send even more jobs overseas. This is a bad deal. Time for smart trade!
6/1/2015 14:13:50	Twitter Web Client	For those of you that have conveniently forgotten, dummy Jon Stewart is a bad filmmaker. His last effort was a real bomb (in all ways)!

4/28/2015 11:55:42	Twitter for Android	President Obama, you have a big job to do. Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together. With proper leadership, it can be done! Do it.
4/28/2015 11:50:31	Twitter for Android	Our country has to come together. We have to start working with, and really liking,  each other. The whole world is watching Baltimore.
4/28/2015 10:14:57	Twitter for Android	The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters "space to destroy" - another real genius!
4/28/2015 9:59:08	Twitter for Android	Now that the ineffective Baltimore  Police have allowed the city to be destroyed, are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?
4/28/2015 4:38:12	Twitter for Android	Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!
4/28/2015 4:28:15	Twitter for Android	Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch. Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots. SAD!
4/28/2015 2:02:46	Twitter for Android	Wow, 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore, some badly! Where is the National Guard. Police must get tough, and fast! Thugs must be stopped.
4/27/2015 14:33:20	Twitter Web Client	Nobody but Donald Trump will save Israel. You are wasting your time with these politicians and political clowns. Best! #SheldonAdelson
4/27/2015 10:57:31	Twitter for Android	Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends  at 7:00 - 5 minutes. Then I head to New Hampshire, great people!
4/25/2015 15:24:13	Twitter for Android	I don't know if Hillary will be able to run, she is a walking time bomb!
4/25/2015 15:20:33	Twitter for Android	.@PennyPritzker Really important to cover currency manipulation in trade agreements - that's where China and others are beating us. Best!
4/25/2015 15:13:40	Twitter for Android	.@NRO  Really important to save National Review from going out of business. We need a true conservative voice!
4/25/2015 14:40:42	Twitter for Android	.@NRO  Not much is as "dead" or irrelevant as National Review thanks to guidance of Goldberg, a total loser! Get some real talent or fold!
4/25/2015 13:57:17	Twitter for Android	.@WayneDupreeShow  A fantastic guy!
4/25/2015 13:48:54	Twitter for Android	Congratulations to @DanaPerino on your book going to number one on Amazon. Great book - Great job!
4/25/2015 10:00:51	Twitter for Android	How do you take care of our people if you don't make anything? We don't make anything. We are rapidly losing our manufacturing to China etc.

4/23/2015 17:55:39	Twitter Web Client	Why are the Republicans giving Obama fast track authority for TPP and the Iran agreement?! Obama gets more from the GOP than his own party.
4/23/2015 17:22:17	Twitter Web Client	Fact – while Jeb was governor &amp; Rubio was House Majority Leader, Florida’s debt more than doubled. Conservatives?
4/23/2015 15:08:34	Twitter Web Client	Excited to be travelling to New Hampshire on Monday. The Granite State is a model for the country. Live Free or Die!
4/23/2015 14:04:42	Twitter Web Client	.@GeraldoRivera Thanks, my champion Geraldo--and very true.
4/23/2015 13:08:02	Twitter for Android	@rightjj;: Should definitely include you in the polls! Why exclude someone with real life experiences in running things successfully?
4/23/2015 13:00:42	Twitter for Android	Do you notice that the polling establishment doesn't put me in polls, but put in folks who hardly register. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
4/22/2015 21:01:50	Twitter Web Client	China has a backdoor into the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This deal does not address currency manipulation. China is laughing at us.
4/22/2015 21:00:17	Twitter Web Client	The Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to even greater unemployment. Do not pass it.
4/22/2015 20:59:35	Twitter Web Client	Republicans should not be giving Obama fast track authority on trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector
4/22/2015 20:56:44	Twitter Web Client	The Trans-Pacific Partnership is an attack on America's business. It does not  stop Japan's currency manipulation. This is a bad deal.
4/22/2015 20:46:42	Twitter for Android	I want to negotiate my own, and much better, trade deals for our country. MUST INCLUDE CURRENCY MANIPULATION (and more). DO NOT LET PASS!
4/22/2015 20:35:56	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to the Republicans in Congress. You are the only people Obama can out negotiate. #TimeToGetTough
4/22/2015 20:30:28	Twitter for Android	I'm getting The Commandant's Leadership Award from the U.S.Marines tonight at The Waldorf Astoria - a great honor!  @BretBaier
4/22/2015 5:58:34	Twitter for Android	.@NRO @JonahNRO  Wow, just looked at the stats for National Review. Dying fast, doing very little business. Save this conservative voice!
4/21/2015 20:28:19	Twitter Web Client	The reason Ed Schultz said nice things about me is that I’m the only Repub who won't cut Social Security, etc. I’ll make America rich again!
4/21/2015 20:15:26	Twitter Web Client	I’m a conservative, but the weakness of conservatives is that they destroy each other, whereas liberals unite to win.
4/21/2015 20:00:08	Twitter Web Client	With a stupid guy like Jonah Goldberg who uses “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” to hit me, no wonder the NRO is doing so poorly. @JonahNRO
4/21/2015 19:58:35	Twitter Web Client	People have been forced to resign positions for far less than @JonahNRO’s “tweeting like a 14 year old girl”
4/21/2015 19:52:29	Twitter Web Client	.@JonahNRO You stated that I started “relentlessly tweeting like a 14-year-old girl...”  Horrible insult to women. Resign now or later!
4/21/2015 17:31:17	Twitter Web Client	Republicans have once again capitulated to Obama. This time on the Iran nuclear treaty. When will it end?
4/21/2015 16:00:52	Twitter Web Client	@RonnieWNichol Just viewed the video of the changes to @TurnberryBuzz. An already stunning course will now be even more spectacular
4/21/2015 14:59:43	Twitter Web Client	Wow, Hillary and Bill are in deep trouble, but don’t worry, my fellow Republicans will let them off the hook. All talk, no action.
4/21/2015 14:15:47	Twitter Web Client	.@DanaPerino wrote a wonderful book, “And the Good News is.."  Dana has a fabulous perspective on life &amp; politics—go get it!
4/21/2015 13:33:30	Twitter Web Client	Glad to see that @PeteRose_14 has been hired by @FOXSports as an analyst. Pete should be around baseball and in the Hall of Fame!
4/21/2015 2:37:03	Twitter for Android	.@stephenfhayes: I heard you were a joke on the media panel this weekend in New Hampshire. You just don't  have what it takes! @JoeNBC
4/21/2015 2:12:54	Twitter for Android	National Review @NRO may  be going out of business because of the really pathetic job being done by @JonahNRO. No talent means death - sad!
4/21/2015 1:35:02	Twitter for Android	.@megynkelly   Sorry, there was only one "breakout star" this weekend in New Hampshire. Just check out the local New Hampshire media!
4/20/2015 23:21:28	Twitter for Android	Jonah Goldberg @JonahNRO of the once great @NRO #National Review is truly dumb as a rock. Why does  @BretBaier put this dummy on his show?
4/20/2015 23:03:02	Twitter for Android	As I have long been saying, South Africa is a total - and very dangerous - mess. Just watch the evening news (when not talking weather).
4/20/2015 22:45:58	Twitter for Android	We are stupidly paying Iran billions of dollars that we should not be paying. Why isn't this part of the nuclear negotiations? Really dumb!
4/20/2015 22:39:49	Twitter for Android	We are getting ready to protect Saudi Arabia against Iran &amp; others-sending ships.  How much are they going to pay us toward this protection.
4/20/2015 19:25:00	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @TrumpSoHo for once again receiving the AAA Five Diamond Award for another year!

4/20/2015 17:20:11	Twitter Web Client	.@weeklystandard  I know your business is failing but you should try to get writers far better than @stephenfhayes.
4/20/2015 13:48:39	Twitter Web Client	How does failed writer and pundit like @stephenfhayes, with no success and little talent, get away with criticizing candidates.
4/20/2015 13:45:22	Twitter Web Client	So much dishonest reporting (or non-reporting) in political media—an amazing experience for me. @BretBaier
4/20/2015 10:28:47	Twitter for Android	I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 - 30 minutes. Some very interesting topics.
4/19/2015 1:38:00	Twitter for Android	Just returned from New Hampshire where the crowd was great-and got a beautiful standing ovation! Wonderful people who truly love the U.S.A.
4/18/2015 11:21:33	Twitter for Android	For all of the haters and losers out there sorry, I never went Bankrupt -- but I did build a world class company and employ many people!
4/18/2015 2:16:53	Twitter for Android	.@georgewillf is perhaps the most boring political pundit on television. Got thrown off ABC like a dog. At Mar-a-Lago he was a total bust!
4/17/2015 23:43:28	Twitter for Android	I do what I do out of pure enjoyment. Hopefully, nobody does it better. Theres a beauty to making a great deal. It's my canvas.
4/17/2015 23:39:34	Twitter for Android	.@BretBaier   Why do you have George Will on your show - he's exhausted, boring and not even a little relevant! Waste of good air-time!
4/17/2015 20:55:41	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to speaking at 1:30PM tomorrow in Nashua at @NHGOP @FITNsummit!. Let's Make America Great Again! #FITN

4/16/2015 19:41:26	Twitter Web Client	Rodolfo Rosas Moya and his pals in Mexico owe me a lot of money. Disgusting &amp; slow Mexico court system. Mexico is not a U.S. friend.

4/7/2015 2:08:03	Twitter for Android	How much money is the  extremely unattractive (both inside and out) Arianna Huffington paying her poor ex-hubby for the use of his name?
4/7/2015 2:00:54	Twitter for Android	As dishonest as @RollingStone is I say @HuffingtonPost is worse. Neither has much money -  sue them and put them out of business!

4/5/2015 4:04:46	Twitter for Android	That Saturday Night Live is able to joke about the Germanwings air tragedy is disgusting. They should apologize to all of those  suffering!
4/2/2015 20:54:17	Twitter Web Client	Oil is under $50/barrel. Now is the time to increase sanctions against Iran, not lift them. No deal is better than a bad deal. #ArtOfTheDeal

4/1/2015 19:38:16	Twitter Web Client	Obama’s offer to Iran will not stop Iran’s breakout capability. It is a bad, desperate deal negotiated from weakness. Pass sanctions!

1/1/2015 7:02:39	Twitter for Android	The Mar-a-Lago Club was amazing tonight. Everybody was there, the biggest and the hottest. Palm Beach is so lucky to have best club in world

12/31/2014 15:52:44	Twitter Web Client	In the end, you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish.
12/31/2014 15:50:39	Twitter Web Client	Without passion you don't have energy, without energy you have nothing. Find work that you love and the energy will be there.
12/31/2014 15:45:09	Twitter Web Client	If you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure, stop trying to balance them. Instead make your work more pleasurable.
12/30/2014 21:50:40	Twitter Web Client	What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate.
12/30/2014 21:47:04	Twitter Web Client	Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.
12/30/2014 21:24:24	Twitter Web Client	Where’s the electability? Jeb is losing to HRC by 13 points. A Bush will never beat a Clinton. Wake up @GOP!

12/29/2014 21:40:12	Twitter Web Client	If you can’t see it, it will never happen. Bring your vision to fruition through perseverance and hard work. That will build momentum.
12/29/2014 15:42:23	Twitter Web Client	Sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make.
12/29/2014 15:39:45	Twitter Web Client	If you're going to be thinking, you may as well think big.
12/29/2014 15:39:01	Twitter Web Client	Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully or write poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks.

12/23/2014 15:46:38	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: Absorb, assess, and then act. Don't negate your own power. Whatever you've been dealt, know you can deal with it.
12/23/2014 15:38:51	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: Realize that fear is the exact opposite of faith. Resolve to be bigger than your problems. Who's the boss?
12/22/2014 16:08:50	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: Whatever happens, you're responsible. If it doesn't happen, you're responsible.
12/22/2014 16:07:51	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs:  Use your imagination. Use your intelligence to execute what your imagination presents to you.

12/19/2014 16:28:57	Twitter Web Client	The movie may be garbage but we can’t let a foreign country dictate to us what to watch.  @SonyPictures
12/19/2014 16:28:49	Twitter Web Client	Amy Pascal of Sony was totally used by Rev. Al Sharpton. She should be fired for stupidity.

12/18/2014 21:18:53	Twitter Web Client	I'll be co-hosting @extratv tonight. Be sure to tune in!
12/17/2014 21:34:11	Twitter Web Client	After destroying the Middle East &amp; our economy, the Bushes last gift was having Justice Roberts legalize ObamaCare. No more Bushes!
12/17/2014 14:59:29	Twitter Web Client	I can’t believe the great @wjcarter got canned by @nytimes. He was a fantastic reporter &amp; really knew entertainment. He will be missed!
12/17/2014 13:49:40	Twitter Web Client	Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. -- Winston Churchill
12/16/2014 21:03:02	Twitter Web Client	Obama has admitted that he spends his mornings watching @ESPN. Then he plays golf, fundraises &amp; grants amnesty to illegals.
12/16/2014 20:45:28	Twitter Web Client	Obama attacks the CIA for  waterboarding while routinely droning civilians caught in the Islamist crosshairs.
12/16/2014 20:04:45	Twitter Web Client	THE LAST THING THIS COUNTRY NEEDS IS ANOTHER BUSH!
12/16/2014 4:19:42	Twitter for Android	How many more times do we all have to watch and pay for that stupid and never ending #SmokeyBearHug commercial. How much is govt. spending?
12/15/2014 21:14:52	Twitter Web Client	The CIA deserves our praise for taking the fight to the enemy in the dark corners of the world. The CIA perseveres, the politicians whine!
12/15/2014 11:53:35	Twitter for Android	I will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 - in 10 minutes. HAVE A GREAT DAY ALL!
12/15/2014 11:40:17	Twitter for Android	No wonder Sony is doing so badly. Really stupid leadership that wants Al Sharpton to help. Watch him turn the tables on chief Amy Pascal.
12/15/2014 11:36:48	Twitter for Android	Can you believe that Sony chief Amy Pascal wants to meet with Al Sharpton to seek forgiveness for her racial slurs. Al is laughing at her!
12/15/2014 0:48:07	Twitter for Android	The Jets should have let them score to get the number one draft pick, who will be really good. It will just never change for them!
12/12/2014 7:44:42	Twitter for Android	Isn't it interesting that immediately after September 11th, everybody was asking for, and indeed demanding, torture of any kind. No reports!
12/12/2014 7:35:02	Twitter for Android	When terrorists are beheading and executing American citizens in such a brutal way,the report on torture should be the least of our concerns
12/12/2014 7:23:43	Twitter for Android	The terrorists cut off the heads of Americans and laugh, then want to sell us the bodies for $1,000,000. We fight over sleep deprivation!
12/11/2014 21:51:45	Twitter Web Client	These Islamists chop Americans’ heads off and want to destroy us. We should be applauding the CIA, not persecuting them.
12/11/2014 21:50:52	Twitter Web Client	If America was under the threat of imminent attack, would Obama use torture or a kiss?
12/11/2014 19:00:39	Twitter Web Client	Policy towards our enemies: Hit them hard, hit them fast, hit them often &amp; then tell them it was because they are the enemy!
12/11/2014 16:11:02	Twitter Web Client	Obama &amp; Democrat leaders did a great disservice by releasing the papers on torture. The world is laughing at us—they think we are fools!
12/11/2014 16:07:02	Twitter Web Client	I will miss @Letterman &amp; doing his show. He was always intriguing &amp; smart. You never knew what would happen --  but he was fair!
12/11/2014 15:15:27	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: Cover your bases. Know everything you can about what you're doing. Then go with your gut. Your instincts r there for a reason
12/11/2014 15:10:52	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs:  See yourself as victorious. Look at the solution, not the problem. And never give up!
12/11/2014 15:09:12	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: View any conflict as an opportunity. Being positive could lead you into a fortunate situation.
12/11/2014 1:18:33	Twitter for Android	Conde Nast made a big mistake going into the World Trade Center. The place is a total disaster, and I feel this is only the beginning!
12/11/2014 1:15:30	Twitter for Android	People are really unhappy with the endless security checks at the new World Trade Center. Durst is a terrible manager. Tenants furious!
12/11/2014 1:09:40	Twitter for Android	Durst is a disaster at operating the new World Trade Center. It takes forever for workers or visitors to get in with impossible security.
12/10/2014 21:02:02	Twitter Web Client	RomneyCare/ObamaCare architect Gruber apologized for his comments. He should apologize for the $2T monstrosity &amp; return all taxpayer money.
12/10/2014 2:53:31	Twitter for Android	President Obama, Gruber and all of the other Obama cronies got ObamaCare passed by lies and fraudulent statements. Courts should overturn!
12/9/2014 20:56:45	Twitter Web Client	Glad to see RomneyCare/ObamaCare architect Gruber being eviscerated on the Hill today. He should return all taxpayer money he was paid.
12/9/2014 20:47:22	Twitter Web Client	ObamaCare continues to increase insurance premiums &amp; raise record deductibles. New Congress must use every tool to defund.
12/9/2014 19:56:30	Twitter Web Client	Very sad &amp; dangerous that soon to be ex-Intelligence Chair Dianne Feinstein released the CIA report. Glad she is losing her Comm. Chair.

12/8/2014 23:35:33	Twitter for Android	Our country and our "leaders" are getting dumber all the time. Now they are about to release full documentation on torture. Will destroy CIA

12/8/2014 21:05:39	Twitter Web Client	The CIA report should not be released. Puts our agents &amp; military overseas in danger. A propaganda tool for our enemies.
12/8/2014 11:50:01	Twitter for Android	They should close down Rolling Stone Magazine after the phony rape charge story. University of Virginia should sue them for big bucks!
12/8/2014 11:27:22	Twitter for Android	I'll be on @foxandfriends this morning at 7:00. So much to talk about!
12/5/2014 15:43:39	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: Believe in yourself! If you don't, no one else will either.
12/5/2014 15:42:37	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: You have to have passion. If you love your work, success will follow.
12/5/2014 15:31:45	Twitter Web Client	I never gave anybody hell! I just told the truth and they thought it was hell. -- Harry S. Truman
12/3/2014 20:00:52	Twitter Web Client	Congress must pass a budget and hold Obama to it. No more continuing resolutions and no more excuses. Republicans soon hold both houses.
12/2/2014 20:07:16	Twitter Web Client	Brainpower is the ultimate leverage. Keep your focus intact!
12/2/2014 18:16:12	Twitter Web Client	Young entrepreneurs: Your success is measured by results. Be productive in the face of challenges. Setbacks are not fatal.
12/2/2014 15:55:31	Twitter Web Client	So sad that Burt Reynolds has lost all of his money. I wish he came to me for advice--he would be rich as hell!
12/1/2014 21:54:40	Twitter Web Client	If ObamaCare should not be repealed then why has Obama &amp; Congress exempted their staffs?
12/1/2014 21:51:59	Twitter Web Client	Obama is community organizing from the Oval Office on Ferguson today. More riots sure to follow.
12/1/2014 21:22:13	Twitter Web Client	Congress’ greatest card against Obama is the power of the purse. Use it!
12/1/2014 21:20:11	Twitter Web Client	Now Obama is keeping our soldiers in Afghanistan for at least another year. He is losing two wars simultaneously.
12/1/2014 20:59:04	Twitter Web Client	.@WhoopiGoldberg Don’t let @Rosie speak badly of you or try to bring you down. She is rude, crude &amp; not smart. She is not in your league.
12/1/2014 20:42:33	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @NYCParks on quickly repairing the Lasker Rink. Record skaters this past Thanksgiving!
12/1/2014 16:08:55	Twitter Web Client	Rosie O’Donnell went after me again on The View in order to stir up her failing ratings. Nothing will help her--@Rosie always fails.
12/1/2014 15:44:56	Twitter Web Client	Ratings way down, show irrelevant. Why haven't they learned? @Rosie always fails.
12/1/2014 14:35:43	Twitter for Android	THE U.S.G.A. Boy's Junior Champion at Trump National Golf Club, Bedminster, just won The Australian Open. We are proud of you  @JordanSpieth
11/30/2014 20:48:37	Twitter for Android	Bill Cosby is foolish, stupid, or getting bad advice in remaining silent if he is innocent. Probably guilty! Not a fan.
11/24/2014 23:51:43	Twitter for Android	Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.
11/24/2014 23:47:00	Twitter for Android	Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
11/24/2014 21:38:39	Twitter Web Client	ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.
11/24/2014 21:30:18	Twitter Web Client	There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.
11/24/2014 20:48:00	Twitter Web Client	Fact – Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.
11/24/2014 20:32:23	Twitter Web Client	Premiering on January 4th, the 14th season of @ApprenticeNBC will have major fireworks every episode. The Board Room is electric!
11/24/2014 19:45:44	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to Chuck Hagel on one of the shortest tenures as Sec. of Defense. Another terrible appointee by Obama.
11/24/2014 14:41:49	Twitter Web Client	Defense Sec.Hagel has quit. Great news for our country. The guy didn’t have a clue—grossly outmatched by our enemies. Couldn't even speak
11/23/2014 23:09:59	Twitter for Android	Tom Brady played great today. He is a total champ and a really nice guy, a rare combination!
11/22/2014 10:41:42	Twitter for Android	Do you think the 14 African nations that are banning West Africans from coming into their nations are racist?
11/22/2014 10:28:28	Twitter for Android	.@aaronschock  Aaron, it was great to meet you at Trump Tower. Also, really good job on television!
11/21/2014 20:12:09	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to Bill O’Brien on being named the Republican Speaker of the NH House. Well-earned &amp; well-deserved. A great guy.
11/21/2014 16:20:59	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs:  Keep your momentum. Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
11/21/2014 16:17:49	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs:  Problems are a mind exercise. Enjoy the challenge.
11/21/2014 16:15:31	Twitter Web Client	If you really want to succeed, you'll have to go for it every day. The big time isn't for slackers. Keep up your stamina and remain curious.
11/21/2014 15:14:47	Twitter Web Client	They're going to riot in Ferguson no matter what.
11/20/2014 21:52:05	Twitter Web Client	You don't necessarily need the best location. What you need is the best deal. -- The Art of the Deal
11/20/2014 20:46:21	Twitter Web Client	If we do not protect the rule of law then we can expect even more illegals to cross the border. Obama’s executive amnesty is dangerous.
11/20/2014 20:29:55	Twitter Web Client	Iraq should be paying us while we fight ISIS. Give the money to the families of our brave soldiers.
11/20/2014 18:55:07	Twitter Web Client	I enjoyed meeting with @MattBlunt @TrumpTowerNY to discuss why our government must address currency manipulation. Many US jobs are at stake.
11/20/2014 14:36:28	Twitter Web Client	Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit &amp; because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress.
11/20/2014 12:52:48	Twitter for Android	I am no fan of Bill Cosby but never-the-less some free advice - if you are innocent, do not remain silent. You look guilty as hell!
11/19/2014 21:17:46	Twitter Web Client	If you don’t publicize your successes, your competitors will be sure to belittle them. Get the word out!
11/19/2014 16:10:08	Twitter Web Client	For those that constantly say that “global warming” is now “climate change”—they changed the name. The name global warming wasn’t working
11/19/2014 14:17:09	Twitter Web Client	@BlakeHoagland  What is the best advice you could give to a young entrepreneur, Mr. Trump? You have to be passionate about your work!
11/19/2014 0:59:19	Twitter for Android	There are many Jonathan Gruber types selling the global warming "stuff" - and they really do believe the American public is stupid.
11/18/2014 21:55:20	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: always remember that deals are fluid. Terms are always negotiable and time can be the best option for success.
11/18/2014 20:44:14	Twitter Web Client	ObamaCare will continue to stop entrepreneurship, slow growth and halt research &amp; development. Defund, Repeal &amp; Replace!
11/18/2014 20:06:17	Twitter Web Client	At least ObamaCare/RomneyCare architect Gruber admitted, albeit privately, that we were lied to by Obama. Gang of Liars.
11/18/2014 18:39:42	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @SixteenChicago @TrumpChicago for being honored with a @MichelinGuideChi two-star rating again this year!
11/18/2014 15:30:26	Twitter Web Client	Just like Jonathan Gruber viciously lied &amp; called Americans “stupid” on ObamaCare, many consultants are doing the same on Global Warming.
11/17/2014 21:29:18	Twitter for BlackBerry	Obama’s China ‘climate’ deal binds America with language of ‘will’ curb emissions now while China only ‘intends’ to curb in 2030. Bad deal!
11/17/2014 18:42:37	Twitter Web Client	ObamaCare/RomneyCare architect Gruber was paid over $6M with our tax dollars yet Obama only claims he ‘was some adviser.’
11/17/2014 17:26:35	Twitter Web Client	Deportations are now at a record low. Obama manipulated the numbers to lie to the public that they were at a record high. Secure the border!
11/17/2014 11:52:41	Twitter for Android	I will be on @foxandfriends  in ten minutes - enjoy!
11/17/2014 4:24:34	Twitter for Android	The entire country is  FREEZING - we desperately need a heavy dose of global warming, and fast! Ice caps size reaches all time high.
11/17/2014 2:37:25	Twitter for Android	I will be on @foxandfriends  tomorrow morning at 7.00. Will be talking about sleazebag Jonathan Gruber ("Americans are stupid") &amp; exec order
11/17/2014 2:26:36	Twitter for Android	. #LaskerRink.  We do not do the maintenance on Lasker Rink, that is done by NEW YORK CITY.
11/16/2014 20:33:03	Twitter for Android	So Obama's top people responsible for ObamaCare think the American Public is stupid! All based on lies and deception! Repubs should sue.
11/14/2014 20:57:20	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to addressing @TheEconomicClub on December 15th at the Marriot Marquis Washington, DC.
11/13/2014 20:31:38	Twitter Web Client	@ryan5240 after playing the new course in Aberdeen and loved it my wife taking me to Turnberry for a birthday present on Monday Great!
11/13/2014 18:51:23	Twitter Web Client	Left New Hampshire for Turnberry in Scotland, which I am renovating. This place is incredible! @TrumpTurnberry
11/13/2014 18:43:34	Twitter Web Client	I really enjoyed being in New Hampshire &amp; speaking for Joe McQuaid @deucecrew &amp; the Nackey Loeb School @LoebSchool honoring James Foley.
11/13/2014 14:30:42	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: Set the bar high. Do the best you possibly can. Apply your skills and talent, but above all, be tenacious.
11/13/2014 14:28:21	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: Set the example. You can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering you are setting the example.
11/12/2014 20:37:36	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: See yourself as victorious. Look at the solution, not the problem. Keep your focus positive.
11/12/2014 18:58:22	Twitter Web Client	Obama’s attack  on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media.
11/12/2014 18:10:58	Twitter Web Client	Flying to New Hampshire to keynote the @LoebSchool First Amendment Award Ceremony. Always great to visit the Granite State!
11/11/2014 21:23:59	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to seeing Joe McQuaid, Curtis Barry and my many friends in the Granite State!
11/11/2014 21:09:20	Twitter Web Client	Today is #VeteransDay. Let us be thankful for our nation’s finest who fight at all corners of the earth to protect our freedoms.
11/11/2014 20:05:32	Twitter Web Client	The ObamaCare website still is not complete. $5 billion and no progress. Scary and sad!
11/11/2014 19:47:30	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to keynoting the Nackey S. Loeb School of Communications First Amendment Awards event tomorrow in New Hampshire.
11/11/2014 19:31:18	Twitter Web Client	Thanks for all of the nice tweets re Sgt. Tahmooressi. Especially nice that the money will be sent today, #VeteransDay.

11/10/2014 11:58:23	Twitter for Android	I will be doing @foxandfriends at 8.00 a.m.
11/9/2014 9:08:17	Twitter for Android	Remember, we don't get any oil from Iraq, China gets whatever ISIS hasn't already taken. So why isn't China sending the troops? Too smart!
11/8/2014 2:39:05	Twitter for Android	Do not go back into Iraq unless they agree, in a signed formal instrument, to give the U.S. 50% of their oil reserves.Make the deal dummies!
11/8/2014 2:33:14	Twitter for Android	We spent TWO TRILLION DOLLARS in Iraq and got NOTHING. Now we are going back and will again get NOTHING because our leaders are clueless!
11/8/2014 2:28:10	Twitter for Android	We are now sending thousands of additional troops to Iraq to teach them how to fight - they will run, billions wasted! WHAT DOES U.S. GET?
11/7/2014 19:22:00	Twitter Web Client	We should immediately stop sending our beautiful American tax dollars to countries that hate us and laugh at our President’s stupidity!
11/7/2014 14:50:57	Twitter Web Client	Autism Speaks' Bob and Suzanne Wright will address the Pontifical Council on Health Care Workers at the Vatican in Rome. November 20-22

11/6/2014 22:17:46	Twitter Web Client	Why did @AGSchneiderman have to fill out 3 successive ballots on Election Day? And this is our A.G.
11/6/2014 19:49:21	Twitter Web Client	Fact – every successful GOP Senate candidate just elected ran on repealing ObamaCare. In January, it’s time to move!
11/6/2014 18:44:31	Twitter for BlackBerry	The new Congress must restore military spending &amp; stop Obama budget cuts. Also, hold Obama accountable on the VA.
11/6/2014 16:22:12	Twitter Web Client	@LukeBryanOnline You were great on The Apprentice! Congrats on your Big CMA win. I promise I won't take credit for your successful career!
11/5/2014 21:05:54	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @CharlieCrist who has now lost a statewide election in Florida as a Republican, Independent &amp; Democrat.
11/5/2014 19:14:52	Twitter Web Client	Had @SenScottBrown asked me to do a robo call for him, I would have done it and he would have won.
11/5/2014 11:49:01	Twitter for Android	.@Team_Mitch   Fantastic win, we are all proud of you! Your victory speech last night was very gracious to an opponent whose speech was not.
11/5/2014 10:25:59	Twitter for Android	A really bad night for President Obama. Now the Republicans have to get together and get the job done!
11/5/2014 10:21:06	Twitter for Android	.@FLGovScott: Amazing race, tremendous courage - you deserved this win for a very old fashioned reason - you have been a great governor!
11/5/2014 2:57:17	Twitter for Android	One year ago I started calling President Obama INCOMPETENT and people thought it was too tough.     Tonight everyone is using that    word!
11/5/2014 2:01:31	Twitter for Android	Looking like a really big night for Republicans - a tremendous refutation of President Obama and his failed policies!
11/5/2014 0:46:01	Twitter for Android	.@Team_Mitch  Congratulations Mitch!
11/5/2014 0:08:16	Twitter for Android	.@ericbolling  Great job on The Five tonight, and not only because you were so nice to The Apprentice. See you soon and thanks!

11/4/2014 20:39:18	Twitter Web Client	Today the Democrats lose big. But tomorrow the Republicans must communicate a positive pro-growth agenda.
11/4/2014 18:48:35	Twitter Web Client	Today is referendum on ObamaCare, Amnesty, slow growth, having your healthcare dropped &amp; all the other lies.
11/4/2014 18:35:21	Twitter Web Client	@ThomTillis, you have run a wonderful campaign. Good luck today!
11/4/2014 18:16:29	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @SenScottBrown on running an aggressive &amp; fair campaign. Vote for Scott today New Hampshire!

11/2/2014 17:11:23	Twitter Web Client	Obama/Reid/Nunn's failed economic policies are not working. @PerdueSenate will bring fresh perspective to solving problems. #GASen
11/2/2014 17:06:43	Twitter Web Client	Strong debate by @PerdueSenate. No question he won. We need more business leaders with bold vision to fix Washington. #GASen
11/2/2014 13:16:27	Twitter for Android	Wow, so far everyone running for office who I did a ROBOCALL for has taken the lead in the polls -- the smart pols know this. GREAT!
11/1/2014 19:12:32	Twitter for Android	.@JudgeJeanine  Tonight at  9 P.M. on @FoxNews - ENJOY!
11/1/2014 13:24:18	Twitter for Android	They finally let our Marine out of a Mexican prison, no thanks to Obama. Way too long. Such an event should never be allowed to happen again
11/1/2014 13:13:10	Twitter for Android	The five prisoners our government so stupidly released for one pathetic traitor are now fighting and killing for ISIS-BAD DEAL! Courtmarshal
11/1/2014 8:37:18	Twitter for Android	Having a truly great imagination is often far more important than having even massive knowledge - but still, never underestimate knowledge!
10/31/2014 20:43:44	Twitter for Android	Crazy - Election officials saying that there is nothing stopping illegal immigrants from voting. This is very bad (unfair) for Republicans!
10/31/2014 18:18:06	Twitter Web Client	Next Tuesday, remember how our president has not lifted a finger for USMC Tahmooressi. He only wants illegals to cross our border.
10/31/2014 16:04:24	Twitter Web Client	@carguy_95 Have you written anything torwards young adults/college students on how to be successful? Think Like a Champion is a good start
10/30/2014 21:18:29	Twitter Web Client	@EWErickson Taking my 9yo to NYC next week for a father-daughter trip. I will take her to see Trump Tower.  Architecture done right.  Thx
10/30/2014 20:46:50	Twitter Web Client	Jeanne Shaheen was the deciding vote for ObamaCare. Premiums have skyrocketed 90% for New Hampshire. Send @SenScottBrown to the Senate!
10/30/2014 20:13:38	Twitter Web Client	Mark Begich votes with Obama 97%. He opposes drilling &amp; supports Amnesty for illegals. Next Tuesday, vote @DanSullivan2014!
10/30/2014 16:58:59	Twitter Web Client	Happy Birthday @IvankaTrump! You are an amazing daughter!
10/30/2014 0:59:06	Twitter for Android	I told you that the Giants starting Hudson was a mistake. Just got knocked out of the game. I love being right!
10/29/2014 20:33:46	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: Keep an open mind! Business is a creative endeavor. There are always opportunities and possibilities.
10/29/2014 20:27:53	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: Look at the solution, not the problem. Learn to focus on what will give results.
10/29/2014 19:55:36	Twitter Web Client	Obama will quarantine all soldiers returning from Africa for 21 days. But he still allows all who contract Ebola into country? Hypocrite.
10/29/2014 19:36:27	Twitter Web Client	Obama admin. called @netanyahu "chickenshit." Ironic since Bibi was an IDF Special Forces commando while Obama was a community organizer.
10/29/2014 9:52:22	Twitter for Android	In game 7 of the World Series tonight, the Giants are making a big mistake in not starting their ace against K.C., even with two days rest.
10/29/2014 9:15:04	Twitter for Android	Just out - the POLAR ICE CAPS are at an all time high, the POLAR BEAR population has never been stronger. Where the hell is global warming?
10/29/2014 9:06:29	Twitter for Android	The U.S. rocket that blew-up and crashed yesterday is emblematic of the United States under Obama. Nothing works, be it a rocket or website.
10/28/2014 23:57:07	Twitter for Android	President Obama strongly considering a plan to bring non-U.S. citizens with Ebola to the United States for treatment. Now I know he's nuts!
10/28/2014 22:00:42	Twitter Web Client	Watch me on @SeanHannity's show at 10PM tonight on @FoxNews
10/28/2014 20:21:36	Twitter Web Client	Success requires 100% of your focus and 100% of your effort. Don't sell yourself short.
10/28/2014 20:19:36	Twitter Web Client	Keep your momentum. Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
10/28/2014 18:15:21	Twitter Web Client	Mark Udall was the deciding vote for ObamaCare &amp; now 250,000 Coloradans were dropped from their plans. Vote @CoryGardner!
10/28/2014 17:40:46	Twitter Web Client	John Foust is a liberal who supports ObamaCare and opposes Ebola travel ban. Send Conservative @BarbaraComstock to Congress!
10/28/2014 14:52:01	Twitter Web Client	All the governors are already backing off of the Ebola quarantines. Bad decision that will lead to more mayhem.
10/28/2014 14:34:53	Twitter Web Client	WH refused a meeting with the Israeli Defense Minister. If only Obama hated Iran as much as he dislikes Israel.
10/28/2014 13:02:59	Twitter Web Client	ObamaCare has brought skyrocketing premium increases &amp; unaffordable deductibles which will lead to less care &amp; job losses.
10/27/2014 21:04:46	Twitter Web Client	Achievers move forward at all times. Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning. Don't waste time treading water.
10/27/2014 19:14:33	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations @Trump_Ireland for being named #12 resort in Europe by the @CNTraveler #ReadersChoice2014 awards!

10/27/2014 14:29:26	Twitter Web Client	I wonder how officials @TexasTech feel now after treating Coach Mike Leach with so little respect after their loss to @TCUFootball 82-27?
10/27/2014 10:59:02	Twitter for Android	Fox &amp; Friends, going on now - enjoy!
10/27/2014 10:24:36	Twitter for Android	Will be on @foxandfriends at 7.00. (30 minutes). A great deal to talk about including Ebola quarantine.
10/26/2014 21:37:15	Twitter for Android	There are just so many penalties and such long commercials in these NFL games that they are no longer worth watching. Soft hitting &amp; boring!
10/26/2014 12:55:11	Twitter for Android	I would absolutely consider investing in Atlantic City again, great and hard working people, but much would have to change-taxes, regs., etc
10/26/2014 12:49:21	Twitter for Android	Yes, I won the right to have my name taken off Trump Plaza in A.C. because it was not operated up to a very high standard and NO involvement
10/26/2014 12:43:34	Twitter for Android	I made a fortune in Atlantic City, got out years ago (great timing), and havn't been back in many years. I have NOTHING to do with A.C.
10/26/2014 11:20:32	Twitter for Android	With all that is happening with Ebola, including the doctor who so easily came back to New York, Obama still refuses to stop the flights!
10/24/2014 20:17:51	Twitter Web Client	There is ZERO margin for error on Ebola. Are we confident in Obama when he can’t even make a website for $5 Billion?
10/24/2014 19:16:55	Twitter Web Client	Michelle Nunn supports Amnesty, a weak border &amp; ObamaCare. She is an Obama liberal. Send DC an independent voice. Vote @Perduesenate!
10/24/2014 18:39:26	Twitter Web Client	Canadian PM Harper immediately called the Ottawa attack terrorism. At least North America has a strong leader who lives in reality.
10/24/2014 13:09:26	Twitter for Android	The Ebola doctor who just flew to N.Y. from West Africa and went on the subway, bowling and dining is a very SELFISH man-should have known!
10/24/2014 4:10:29	Twitter for Android	President Obama, you are a complete and total disaster, but you have a chance to do something great and important: STOP THE FLIGHTS!
10/24/2014 3:54:09	Twitter for Android	President Obama has a major meeting on the N.Y.C. Ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf!
10/24/2014 3:43:33	Twitter for Android	I never thought I'd say it in my lifetime, but President Barack Hussein Obama, aka Barry Sotoro, is a far worse president than Jimmy Carter!
10/24/2014 2:31:24	Twitter for Android	I have been saying for weeks for President Obama to stop the flights from West Africa. So simple, but he refused. A TOTAL incompetent!
10/24/2014 2:24:55	Twitter for Android	Ebola has been confirmed in N.Y.C., with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact with.Obama's fault
10/23/2014 23:38:59	Twitter for Android	If this doctor, who so recklessly flew into New York from West Africa,has Ebola,then Obama should apologize to the American people &amp; resign!
10/23/2014 23:24:32	Twitter for Android	There is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in West Africa and who FLEW into New York has Ebola. Touched many, bedlam!
10/23/2014 23:10:47	Twitter for Android	Double digit premium increases because of ObamaCare. Dems trying to delay showing numbers until after election, but news is spreading fast!
10/23/2014 9:31:09	Twitter for Android	Tremendous pressure on President Obama to institute a travel ban on Ebola stricken West Africa. At some point this stubborn dope will fold!
10/22/2014 20:25:09	Twitter Web Client	Alison Grimes supports harsh restrictions to kill coal industry &amp; supports Obama's anti-gun legislation. Vote @Team_Mitch!
10/22/2014 19:15:02	Twitter Web Client	Liberal SD Dem candidate Rick Weiland wants to expand ObamaCare to single payer &amp; opposes Ebola travel ban. Send @RoundsforSenate to Senate!
10/22/2014 16:40:18	Twitter Web Client	If Mitt Romney were in the private sector &amp; he suffered the horrendous loss of 2012, do you think he’d rehire himself for 2016?—I don’t!
10/22/2014 15:47:29	Twitter Web Client	Later today I’m being honored at the Park Hyatt in Washington, D.C. by the Wharton Club. The Joseph Wharton Award Dinner. A great honor.
10/22/2014 13:42:39	Twitter Web Client	Ben Bradlee was truly one of the greats. What an amazing life he led. My warmest condolences to Dino &amp; the whole family. #BenBradlee
10/22/2014 12:17:50	Twitter for Android	I'm going to D.C. today to check on the hotel I'm building on Penn. AVE., and then being honored by the Wharton School of Finance, the BEST!
10/22/2014 11:40:28	Twitter for Android	Why are we letting the three girls, who left the U.S. to join ISIS, back into the country? How stupid has our once respected country become!
10/22/2014 8:14:57	Twitter for Android	If there is one more Ebola case in the U.S., a full travel ban will be instituted. This common sense move should have been done long ago!
10/21/2014 23:47:29	Twitter for Android	The United States troops which were sent to West Africa have only gotten 4 hours of Ebola training - very unfair to them and their families!
10/21/2014 23:41:29	Twitter for Android	The United States, under President Obama, has truly become the "gang that couldn't shoot straight." Everything he touches turns to garbage!
10/21/2014 23:34:34	Twitter for Android	The U.S. accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of ISIS as enemy laughs! Very sad!
10/21/2014 20:53:25	Twitter Web Client	Negotiation is an art. Treat it like one.
10/21/2014 19:24:12	Twitter Web Client	Don’t believe Kay Hagan on Ebola travel ban. She also promised that you would keep your healthcare plan under ObamaCare. Vote @ThomTillis!
10/21/2014 19:14:24	Twitter Web Client	Obama will let Ebola fly into US &amp; drugrunners cross our border daily. But he won't pressure Mexico on Sgt. Tahmooressi. #FreeOurMarine
10/21/2014 15:34:05	Twitter Web Client	I will be in Washington, D.C. tomorrow to receive the 2014 Joseph Wharton Award at the Wharton Club of D.C.—a great honor! @Wharton
10/21/2014 11:18:22	Twitter for Android	Oscar Pistorious will likely only serve 10 months for the cold blooded murder of his girlfriend. Another O.J. travesty.The judge is a moron!
10/21/2014 9:20:56	Twitter for Android	Wow, one of the all-time greats in fashion, OSCAR DE LA RENTA, has just died at 82. Great fashion achievements but also a really nice guy!
10/21/2014 9:05:50	Twitter for Android	Oscar Pistorius only gets five years in prison for killing his girlfriend. Ridiculous decision! Judge couldn't even read her own writings.
10/20/2014 23:05:33	Twitter for Android	Has everyone forgotten our marine who now sits in a Mexican prison because we have a president too incompetent or too lazy to make a call?
10/20/2014 19:37:24	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @TrumpCollection’s @TrumpPanama for receiving the Certificate of Excellence &amp; Top 10 Hotels in Panama from @TripAdvisor!
10/20/2014 16:57:07	Twitter Web Client	Congrats to @TrumpWaikiki for being named @Orbitz Best In Stay Elite Award Winner for Oahu for 2014!
10/20/2014 14:36:25	Twitter Web Client	.@AGSchneiderman must take a drug test immediately—make results public. NY Attorney General cannot be a cokehead.
10/20/2014 12:20:06	Twitter for Android	I was never a fan of Bush, in fact, he was so bad he gave us Obama! But Obama is truly a pathetic excuse of a president, can't get any worse
10/20/2014 10:12:15	Twitter for Android	I will be on @foxandfriends at 7.00 - 45 minutes. Talking about Ebola, Obama and other strange U.S. happenings!
10/19/2014 13:14:52	Twitter for Android	I just returned from Iowa - what a beautiful state. The people are amazing and the event for Congressman Steve King was a great success!
10/19/2014 10:41:04	Twitter for Android	Do you believe Obama just said that America would be "less safe" with a travel ban from West Africa.This is the thinking of a total mad man!
10/19/2014 10:30:14	Twitter for Android	The lobbyist and political hack that President Obama just appointed as the "Ebola Czar," just missed his first major meeting on Ebola-A joke
10/18/2014 17:40:05	Twitter for Android	I'm leaving for Iowa now - will be great!
10/18/2014 0:47:32	Twitter for Android	If I were president Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi would be let out of jail with one phone call. If not,Mexico would pay a price like never before!
10/18/2014 0:23:02	Twitter for Android	Do you think the 14 African nations that are banning West Africans from coming into their nations are being called racists? Perhaps not!
10/18/2014 0:19:23	Twitter for Android	14 African nations have totally banned West Africans from entering their nations. Likewise many other nations. But the U.S. = "COME ON IN"
10/17/2014 22:20:00	Twitter for Android	Obama just appointed an Ebola Czar with zero experience in the medical area and zero experience in infectious disease control. A TOTAL JOKE!
10/17/2014 20:51:40	Twitter Web Client	If you can’t see it, you can’t make it happen. Entrepreneurs, chase your dreams with resolute focus &amp; determination. Be positive!
10/17/2014 19:48:11	Twitter Web Client	Now Michelle Nunn will not admit she voted for Obama. Of course she did. Nunn supports ObamaCare &amp; is anti-Second Amendment.
10/17/2014 19:32:02	Twitter Web Client	The new Ebola czar will report to the WH &amp; NSA adviser Susan Rice. More mismanagement &amp; duplicity with CDC. Obama is terrible executive.
10/17/2014 19:19:18	Twitter Web Client	.@yuSiddiqui @piersmorgan @rustyrockets  I got much better—no contest—I got Melania!
10/17/2014 19:18:50	Twitter Web Client	.@piersmorgan Russell has nothing going for himself except for energy &amp; aggression. Without that he would be dead—a first class dummy!
10/17/2014 16:19:44	Twitter Web Client	Very excited to be returning to Iowa tomorrow to campaign for my friend &amp; strong Conservative leader @SteveKingIA!
10/17/2014 16:12:03	Twitter Web Client	I love seeing that Graydon Carter and @VanityFair are failing so badly. He’s only focused on his bad food restaurants.
10/17/2014 0:53:37	Twitter for Android	Looks like Obama will not stop the very potentially dangerous flights to and from West Africa. What the hell is wrong with this guy?
10/17/2014 0:08:12	Twitter for Android	.@katyperry  I watched Russell Brand and I think his mind is fried - he looks really bad. Russell is a total joke, a dummy who is lost!
10/16/2014 23:52:22	Twitter for Android	.@katyperry  Katy, what the hell were you thinking when you married loser Russell Brand. There is a guy who has got nothing going, a waste!
10/16/2014 21:00:48	Twitter Web Client	.@katyperry must have been drunk when she married Russell Brand @rustyrockets – but he did send me a really nice letter of apology!
10/16/2014 20:50:24	Twitter Web Client	I watched Russell Brand @rustyrockets on the @jimmyfallon show the other night—what the hell do people see in Russell—a major loser!
10/16/2014 12:11:37	Twitter for Android	The Ebola nurse should NEVER have been allowed to fly to Cleveland and (amazing) back again. Nothing works in our once great country anymore
10/16/2014 8:23:30	Twitter for Android	I am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with President Obama's mental health. Why won't he stop the flights. Psycho!
10/16/2014 8:16:27	Twitter for Android	It is time for the airline pilots, flight attendants and the airlines themselves to stop flights to and from West Africa. Do it right now!
10/16/2014 0:27:02	Twitter for Android	I just had a great victory against lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Most of his case re Trump U. was thrown out or gutted. Little remains
10/15/2014 22:40:12	Twitter for Android	I can't believe that Mitt Romney would run for president again. He had his chance and blew it in the last weeks of the race.
10/15/2014 22:36:44	Twitter for Android	A nurse in Dallas who treated Ebola patient Thomas Duncan was allowed to fly to Cleveland.She should never have been so allowed! The real JV
10/15/2014 22:23:52	Twitter for Android	With all of the words President Obama just dispensed at his press conference, he didn't say what we all want to hear,"I'LL STOP THE FLIGHTS"
10/15/2014 19:29:55	Twitter Web Client	Young entrepreneurs – always remember in negotiations that sometimes the best deal you make is the one you walk away from.
10/15/2014 19:01:45	Twitter Web Client	Our president could not make a proper website with $5B. The website still does not work. How can we feel safe about Ebola?!
10/15/2014 17:58:29	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to returning to the Hawkeye state this Saturday to support my friend and strong Conservative @SteveKingIA!
10/15/2014 16:18:38	Twitter Web Client	Lightweight @AGSchneiderman is driving business &amp; jobs out of NY. Only wants self publicity—a total loser!
10/15/2014 16:18:27	Twitter Web Client	John @CahillForAG is one of the most respected people in politics. Dopey @AGSchneiderman is one of the least respected!
10/15/2014 14:32:04	Twitter Web Client	President Obama has a personal responsibility to visit &amp; embrace all people in the US who contract Ebola!
10/15/2014 11:43:50	Twitter for Android	Obama still refuses to stop the flights. Is he stubborn or just plain incompetent - I say both!
10/14/2014 20:11:43	Twitter Web Client	It's Tuesday. @AGSchneiderman is wearing Revlon eyeliner today. Governor Cuomo alerted all to this.
10/14/2014 19:42:16	Twitter Web Client	Michelle Nunn will be a solid vote for  Obama. She supports ObamaCare &amp; opposes 2nd Amendment. Vote for  @Perduesenate to change things!
10/14/2014 19:35:27	Twitter Web Client	We pay for Obama's travel so he can fundraise millions so Democrats can run on lies. Then we pay for his golf.
10/14/2014 18:59:34	Twitter Web Client	Alison Grimes will protect the 'sanctity' of her Obama ballot yet admits she voted for Hillary in primary. Hypocrite. Vote @Team_Mitch!
10/14/2014 14:34:53	Twitter Web Client	If you want more, you have to require more from yourself. -- Dr. Phil McGraw
10/14/2014 3:17:34	Twitter for Android	As ISIS and Ebola spread like wildfire, the Obama administration just submitted a paper on how to stop climate change (aka global warming).
10/14/2014 0:03:51	Twitter for Android	Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter
10/13/2014 20:32:50	Twitter Web Client	If you never want to be criticized, for goodness' sake don't do anything new. -- Jeff Bezos
10/13/2014 20:01:49	Twitter Web Client	If Alison Grimes can’t admit she voted for Obama, even if she is embarrassed, then you can’t trust her! Vote @Team_Mitch!
10/13/2014 18:38:25	Twitter Web Client	The military generals are fuming at Obama. He has boxed them in against ISIS with a strategy that is destined to fail. Sad!
10/13/2014 17:49:42	Twitter Web Client	Happy belated birthday to Chris Wallace! Chris does a great job every week on @FoxNewsSunday. Like father, like son.
10/13/2014 16:56:05	Twitter Web Client	Just finished reading a poorly written &amp; very boring book on the General Motors Building by Vicky Ward. Waste of time! @WileyBiz
10/13/2014 14:49:39	Twitter Web Client	Think of this: After we spent $2 trillion on Iraq, Baghdad is about to be taken over by ISIS.
10/13/2014 14:12:45	Twitter Web Client	The @nfl games are so boring now that actually, I’m glad I didn’t get the Bills. Boring games, too many flags, too soft!
10/13/2014 14:11:46	Twitter Web Client	Even though I refused to pay a ridiculous price for the Buffalo Bills, I would have produced a winner. Now that won’t happen.
10/13/2014 14:11:29	Twitter Web Client	The people of Buffalo should be happy Terry Pegula got the team but I hope he does better w/the Bills than he has w/the Sabres. Good luck!
10/13/2014 13:21:14	Twitter for Android	Wow, China exports rise 15% in September. They are laughing at USA!
10/13/2014 10:43:50	Twitter for Android	.@foxandfriends in 15 minutes!
10/13/2014 1:53:02	Twitter for Android	Are NFL games getting boring or is it just my magnificent imagination? In any event, I'm just not watching them much anymore!
10/13/2014 1:24:02	Twitter for Android	I will be on Fox &amp; Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00. Ebola and ISIS will be topics.
10/12/2014 13:17:03	Twitter for Android	I don't know if President Obama isn't stopping the flights from Ebola torn West Africa because he is stubborn, stupid, or just doesn't care!
10/12/2014 13:11:04	Twitter for Android	Here we go - A healthcare worker who treated Thomas Duncan, the man who flew into the U.S. from West Africa infected with Ebola, caught it!
10/11/2014 22:54:26	Twitter for Android	President Obama, NOW, bring our 4000 innocent and ill-trained soldiers home from West Africa, before it is too late, AND STOP THE FLIGHTS!
10/11/2014 11:25:26	Twitter for Android	Remember when I said when Saddam Hussein fell - the new leader of Iraq will be meaner and tougher and hate the U.S. even more. Welcome ISIS!
10/11/2014 10:32:15	Twitter for Android	If a conservative Republican made the mistake that Mrs. Obama just made by calling Braley by the wrong name, it would be the biggest story!
10/11/2014 10:28:24	Twitter for Android	Michelle Obama made a terrible mistake in Iowa. When endorsing Bruce Braley before a large crowd, she called him Bruce Bailey seven times.
10/11/2014 10:15:09	Twitter for Android	Isn't it ridiculous, starting today, new Ebola screenings go into effect for people coming from West Africa. Just stop the flights dummies!
10/11/2014 10:04:49	Twitter for Android	I've never seen anything like it, everything he touches turns to gold!  So nice, a quote by Fred C.Trump about his son Donald (me!).
10/11/2014 4:25:43	Twitter for Android	Do you notice that because of Ebola, ISIS etc., ObamaCare has gone to the back burner despite horrible results coming out. A disaster!
10/10/2014 20:54:59	Twitter Web Client	Obama: “I will control Ebola.” = Obama: “If you like your health care plan, you can keep your healthcare plan.”
10/10/2014 20:39:13	Twitter Web Client	Wow. @nfl ratings are down big league. Glad I didn't get the Bills. Rather be lucky than good.
10/10/2014 20:35:24	Twitter Web Client	The @nfl ratings continue to fall every week and will keep dropping. Boring games--too many flags--too soft!
10/10/2014 20:34:05	Twitter Web Client	The only reason I bid on @buffalobills was to make sure they stayed in Buffalo, where they belong. Mission accomplished.
10/10/2014 19:37:21	Twitter Web Client	Sweat equity is the most valuable equity there is. Know your business and industry better than anyone else in the world. @mcuban
10/10/2014 14:33:20	Twitter Web Client	.@AGSchneiderman should remove his eyeliner, as pointed out by Cuomo, when he does his commercials!
10/10/2014 14:32:48	Twitter Web Client	Lightweight @AGSchneiderman will probably win only because he is a Dem in NY, but what a loser!
10/10/2014 14:32:41	Twitter Web Client	Lightweight @AGSchneiderman, the worst attorney general in the US, is in a tough election with John Cahill  @CahillForAG
10/10/2014 13:23:20	Twitter Web Client	Obamacare puts poor people on a form of government run, single-payer health insurance that many doctors don't take - @Avik
10/10/2014 13:11:10	Twitter for Android	Obama is making the Ebola problem much worse than it needs to be in the U.S. by not halting flights from West Africa. Airport testing a joke
10/10/2014 9:04:13	Twitter for Android	If you are interested in balancing work and pleasure, you will never succeed!
10/10/2014 8:44:33	Twitter for Android	I feel sorry for the 4000 soldiers who are being forced to go the West Africa to fight Ebola. Their families are up in arms. Not trained.
10/10/2014 8:25:01	Twitter for Android	Tens of millions of dollars in airstrikes had no impact because key leaders fled after hearing ON NEWS REPORTS the strikes were coming. DUMB
10/10/2014 0:49:16	Twitter for Android	China is ripping wealth out Africa and yet, as usual, refuses to put anything back to help with Ebola. "Let the stupid Americans do it!" SAD
10/9/2014 21:17:07	Twitter Web Client	The residential real estate market continues to provide opportunities for first time home owners. Buy now if you can!
10/9/2014 21:05:39	Twitter Web Client	The CDC chief just said Ebola is spreading faster than Aids. Marines are preparing for a pandemic drill. Stop all flights from West Africa!
10/9/2014 20:49:36	Twitter Web Client	Obama won’t send troops to fight jihadists, yet sends them to Liberia to contract Ebola. He is a delusional failure.
10/9/2014 20:01:19	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @piersmorgan on his new position as Editor-at-Large for the United States of @MailOnline! My Apprentice champ!
10/9/2014 16:28:27	Twitter Web Client	I have to admit @AlexSalmond is a tough, smart guy. He is formidable by any standard!
10/9/2014 13:17:04	Twitter for Android	Right now 4000 U.S. troops are stupidly heading to West Africa to help fight Ebola.No help from China, Russia or wealthy African oil nations
10/9/2014 11:37:53	Twitter for Android	The U.S. is spending fortunes at airports checking people coming in from West Africa, with uncertain results. STOP THE FLIGHTS YOU DUMB B's!
10/9/2014 11:25:29	Twitter for Android	In a little reported event, China has just overtaken the United States as the NUMBER ONE World economic power! Great going Washington!
10/9/2014 10:28:13	Twitter for Android	Even Jimmy Carter just released a statement saying that Obama doesn't have a clue. That has to be a new low!
10/9/2014 4:04:02	Twitter for Android	Obama, stop the flights to and from West Africa NOW - before it is too late! Can't you see what's happening? Can you be that thick (stupid)?
10/9/2014 3:58:59	Twitter for Android	Can you believe this fool, Dr. Thomas Frieden of CDC, just stated, "anyone with fever should be asked if they have been in West Africa" DOPE
10/8/2014 21:28:16	Twitter Web Client	Any American who fights with ISIS should have their passport revoked. Take them to Gitmo for interrogation.
10/8/2014 21:26:47	Twitter Web Client	The fight against ISIS starts at our border. ‘At least’ 10 ISIS have been caught crossing the Mexico border. Build a wall!
10/8/2014 21:09:10	Twitter Web Client	China has just overtaken us as the world’s largest economy. We are busy wasting $'s while China builds airports &amp; skyscrapers.
10/8/2014 19:11:04	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs: See yourself as victorious. Look at the solution, not the problem.
10/8/2014 14:23:59	Twitter Web Client	ISIS is advancing even against Obama’s airstrikes. Obama is disengaged and making the Middle East even more dangerous.
10/8/2014 14:03:47	Twitter Web Client	Obamacare premiums continue to rise and bend up the cross curve. And the back-end of the website does not even work.
10/8/2014 12:20:03	Twitter for Android	Obama is looking like an incompetent fool in the handling of the war against.ISIS! Why isn't China and Russia helping - they gain so much!
10/8/2014 12:09:04	Twitter for Android	I was relentless because, more often than you would think, sheer persistence is the difference between success and failure. NEVER GIVE UP!
10/7/2014 21:13:35	Twitter Web Client	Real estate taxes are far too high @BriarcliffManor, Westchester. A total joke how they waste money! Replace Mayor Vescio.
10/7/2014 21:13:28	Twitter Web Client	When will Mayor Vescio and manager Zegarelli repave Pine Road in @BriarcliffManor?  It is a disgrace!
10/7/2014 20:51:21	Twitter Web Client	Be sure to enjoy the ‘50th Anniversary Chicago International Film Festival’ at @TrumpChicago, the Windy City’s top hotel!
10/7/2014 20:32:53	Twitter Web Client	USMC Andrew Tahmooressi should be freed immediately. He never should have been jailed in the first place. Weak leaders. #FreeOurMarine

10/7/2014 15:03:07	Twitter Web Client	Just put in ad for a real estate executive: “Hard work, low pay, mean boss!”
10/7/2014 10:08:22	Twitter for Android	Despite the ever increasing Ebola disaster, Obama refuses to stop flights from West Africa.It's almost like he's saying F-you to U.S. public
10/6/2014 20:37:29	Twitter Web Client	Obama has missed 58% of his intelligence briefings. But our president does make 100% of his fundraisers.
10/6/2014 20:09:28	Twitter Web Client	I will be on On The Record @gretawire tonight at 7 PM
10/6/2014 16:14:16	Twitter Web Client	.@ScotGolfPodcast Work has not yet begun. We're in the approval phase. It will be amazing. You will love the final result.
10/6/2014 13:43:43	Twitter Web Client	Do you think crooked @AGSchneiderman will ever challenge the NFL tax status? No—too many friends and contributors in @nfl?
10/6/2014 10:17:32	Twitter for Android	I will be on Fox &amp; Friends (@foxandfriends) at 7.00. Fighting Ebola will be a topic!
10/6/2014 0:03:35	Twitter for Android	I'm not going to be watching much NFL football anymore. Too time consuming, too boring, too many flags and too soft. Focus on other things!
10/5/2014 22:13:52	Twitter for Android	What the hell is Obama doing in allowing all of these potentially very sick people to continue entering the U.S.! Is he stupid or arrogant?
10/5/2014 22:02:19	Twitter for Android	I don't know what it is, but I'm getting totally bored watching NFL football. Too many penalties and far too soft! T.V. off and back to work
10/5/2014 21:57:15	Twitter for Android	The Jets just don't have it. Time for a quarterback change!
10/5/2014 3:21:26	Twitter for Android	President Obama, I have an idea! Pretend that West Africa is Israel and then you will be able to stop the Ebola area flights.
10/5/2014 0:05:59	Twitter for Android	President Obama - close down the flights from Ebola infected areas right now, before it is too late! What the hell is wrong with you?
10/4/2014 17:14:49	Twitter for Android	Something very important, and indeed society changing, may come out of the Ebola epidemic that will be a very good thing: NO SHAKING HANDS!
10/4/2014 15:35:31	Twitter for Android	This Ebola patient Thomas Duncan, who fraudulently entered the U.S. by signing false papers, is causing havoc. If he lives, prosecute!
10/4/2014 15:24:59	Twitter for Android	If Ebola is so non-contagious, how come an NBC cameraman caught it so quickly while over in West Africa? U.S. is behaving very foolishly!
10/4/2014 13:26:21	Twitter for Android	Can you believe that President Obama still hasn't stopped the flights and people pouring into the U.S. from West Africa. TERRIBLE PRESIDENT!
10/3/2014 1:19:39	Twitter for Android	Saw Michael Jordan and Ray Allen today playing golf at Trump National Doral, the Blue Monster. Great guys!
10/2/2014 23:08:15	Twitter for Android	Ebola patient Duncan lied on his exit papers by saying he never came into contact with a person with Ebola. He knew he did, and person died.
10/2/2014 22:43:25	Twitter for Android	How incompetent are our leaders allowing these Ebola infected people to come into our country with all of the problems and danger entailed!
10/2/2014 22:38:04	Twitter for Android	The Ebola patient who came into our country knew exactly what he was doing. Came into contact with over 100 people.Here we go-I told you so!
10/2/2014 11:34:41	Twitter for Android	The brand new hotel at Trump National Doral has the most beautiful rooms and suites in Miami.  Enjoy!
10/2/2014 11:28:36	Twitter for Android	I just arrived at Trump National Doral in Miami where I'll spend the day checking work just completed by contractors. This place is amazing!
10/2/2014 9:52:50	Twitter for Android	Ebola is much easier to transmit than the CDC and government representatives are admitting. Spreading all over Africa-and fast. Stop flights
10/1/2014 19:28:56	Twitter Web Client	We have millions in our country unemployed yet we are wasting millions arming Syrian ‘rebels.’ What is wrong with Washington?!
10/1/2014 19:10:02	Twitter Web Client	Obama can attend a fundraiser every day but can’t be bothered to get briefed on national security. Commander-in-Chief?!
10/1/2014 18:55:51	Twitter Web Client	Our national security starts at the border. Do you think ISIS &amp; al-Qaeda are just in the Middle East?
10/1/2014 12:41:30	Twitter for Android	How is ABC Television allowed to have a show entitled "Blackish"? Can you imagine the furor of a show, "Whiteish"! Racism at highest level?
10/1/2014 10:46:16	Twitter for Android	Stop flights into the U.S. from West Africa immediately!
10/1/2014 10:08:28	Twitter for Android	The woman who is the Secret Service Director looks like she is way over her head.Why can't the president appoint the best and the brightest?
10/1/2014 7:01:20	Twitter for Android	@CalebCCooper Reading DonaldTrump's The Art of the Deal" for my entrepreneurship class. So many cool stories and business lessons to learn
10/1/2014 0:36:01	Twitter for Android	The United States must immediately institute strong travel restrictions or Ebola will be all over the United States-a plague like no other!
10/1/2014 0:21:11	Twitter for Android	How dumb is our president to send thousands of poorly trained and ill-equipped soldiers over to West Africa to fight Ebola. Stop all flights
10/1/2014 0:09:29	Twitter for Android	Here we go! I stated long ago that we should cancel all flights from West Africa. Now we have Ebola in U.S., AND IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE!
9/30/2014 23:45:01	Twitter for Android	President Obama should stay out of the Hong Kong protests, we have enough problems in our own country!Can't even properly police White House

9/30/2014 20:15:46	Twitter Web Client	Fact--Obama does not read his intelligence briefings nor does he get briefed in person by the CIA or DOD. Too busy I guess!
9/30/2014 19:15:59	Twitter Web Client	Keep your momentum. Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
9/30/2014 19:12:20	Twitter Web Client	I've realized that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus. Nothing less. Get out there and go for it.
9/29/2014 20:39:00	Twitter Web Client	Jeanne Shaheen wants amnesty for illegals, placed the deciding vote for  ObamaCare &amp; opposes the 2nd Amendment. Vote her out in November!
9/29/2014 20:17:44	Twitter Web Client	Obama:“I will destroy ISIS” = Obama: “If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your plan.”

9/29/2014 15:01:53	Twitter Web Client	I thought I was being nice to somebody re their parents. I guess this teaches you not to be nice or trusting. Sad!
9/29/2014 15:01:38	Twitter Web Client	Some jerk fraudulently tweeted that his parents said I was a big inspiration to them + pls RT—out of kindness I retweeted. Maybe I’ll sue.
9/29/2014 11:35:47	Twitter for Android	.@CharlieRymerGC  Charlie, call me - we'll set up a match with Gary and Damon. Doral now finished and doing great!

9/27/2014 2:10:01	Twitter for Android	The animal who beheaded the woman in Oklahoma should be given a very fast trial and then the death penalty. The same fate - beheading?
9/26/2014 22:52:39	Twitter for Android	I wonder if I run for PRESIDENT, will the haters and losers vote for me knowing that I will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? I say they will!
9/26/2014 22:35:57	Twitter for Android	Can you believe we still have not gotten our Marine out of Mexico. He sits in prison while our PRESIDENT plays golf and makes bad decisions!
9/26/2014 20:12:02	Twitter Web Client	My friend Derek is a special athlete and special person--there is nobody like him. @Yankees

9/25/2014 17:18:34	Twitter Web Client	When you’re in a fight with a bully, always throw the first punch—and don’t telegraph it—hit hard &amp; hit fast!
9/25/2014 15:41:49	Twitter Web Client	The U.S. should not be giving away our strategy &amp; tactics to the enemy so they can prepare. Just go and do what you have to do!

9/24/2014 19:48:34	Twitter Web Client	Someone unknown tweeted incorrectly that I'm for Sen. Mitch @McConnellPress for speaker. I'm supporting him for Senate Majority Leader
9/23/2014 19:44:12	Twitter Web Client	Zegarelli and Vescio:  Pine Road looks like hell. Must be re-paved now—very bad for town.  @BriarcliffManor
9/23/2014 10:41:31	Twitter for Android	According to many, ISIS was given so much time and so many signals as to when we would start bombing that they were able to prepare and hide
9/23/2014 2:22:12	Twitter Web Client	Why would the people of Kentucky want a rookie Senator– they have Sen. Mitch @McConnellPress who may be next Leader &amp; bring $’s to KY
9/22/2014 19:25:32	Twitter Web Client	Now Obama is having our army coordinate with Iran against ISIS. What’s next?
9/22/2014 19:24:07	Twitter Web Client	Obama’s rollout of his ISIS war plan is another unmitigated disaster. The Generals must be furious.
9/22/2014 13:49:37	Twitter Web Client	Briarcliff Manor Mayor Vescio is doing a terrible job. Taxes way too high, roads in terrible condition—repave Pine Road. @BriarcliffManor
9/22/2014 10:34:21	Twitter for Android	Good morning. I will be on Fox and Friends at 7.00 (30 minutes). Enjoy! @foxandfriends
9/20/2014 14:19:55	Twitter for Android	The NFL should have its non-profit status immediately revoked while at the same time ending the giant tax scam which makes teams so valuable
9/20/2014 13:12:07	Twitter for Android	The NFL image is really tarnished! Now, if the sponsors start leaving and the ratings go down, the NFL will be in big trouble. Boring games!
9/20/2014 13:05:57	Twitter for Android	They just called this the biggest scandal in U.S. sports history (GMA). Roger looks really weak and indecisive, must put on a better front!
9/20/2014 9:03:24	Twitter for Android	What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate.
9/20/2014 8:52:34	Twitter for Android	Do you believe that Obama is giving weapons to "moderate rebels" in Syria.Isn't sure who they are. What the hell is he doing.Will turn on us
9/20/2014 1:44:26	Twitter for Android	Why are we sending thousands of ill-trained soldiers into Ebola infested areas of Africa! Bring the plague back to U.S.? Obama is so stupid.
9/19/2014 20:40:32	Twitter for Android	Roger Goodell must stop apologizing to everyone who will listen and toughen up. His street smart players are laughing at him and the NFL!

9/17/2014 20:45:35	Twitter Web Client	The Iraqi army has squandered the majority of the weapons &amp; training we gave them for 10 long years. When will we learn?
9/17/2014 20:45:02	Twitter Web Client	So Obama wants to bomb ISIS in Iraq &amp; arm them in Syria? What is he doing!
9/17/2014 20:39:02	Twitter Web Client	Are the Republicans going to blow their chance to take the Senate? Must focus on ObamaCare and amnesty.
9/17/2014 14:30:57	Twitter Web Client	It was a great honor to be on @MikeAndMike on @espn. Wow, the response was amazing!
9/17/2014 11:29:20	Twitter for Android	On Mike and Mike, @espn in two minutes!
9/16/2014 22:25:09	Twitter for Android	In order to stop the Ebola outbreak in Africa, perhaps the President should put all Africans on ObamaCare rather than sending the troops!
9/16/2014 20:39:34	Twitter Web Client	Every day Mexico continues to hold Sgt. Tahmooressi is an insult to our country.
9/16/2014 16:46:56	Twitter Web Client	Just met with David Perdue @Perduesenate. He’s a fantastic guy who will fight hard against ObamaCare. He will win!

9/16/2014 12:55:22	Twitter for Android	Does anybody notice that Atlantic City lost its magic after I left years ago. I had the big boxing, introduced UFC (ask Dana),the best shows
9/16/2014 12:49:28	Twitter for Android	Can you believe that the U.S. will be sending 3000 troops to Africa to help with Ebola.They will come home infected? We have enough problems
9/16/2014 12:16:09	Twitter for Android	It is so sad to see what has happened to Atlantic City. So many bad decisions by the pols over the years - airport, convention center, etc.
9/16/2014 12:13:04	Twitter for Android	I left Atlantic City years ago, good timing. Now I may buy back in, at much lower price,  to save Plaza &amp; Taj. They were run badly by funds!
9/15/2014 20:47:19	Twitter Web Client	If you can’t focus with unyielding resolve, then you will never be successful. Believe in yourself and you can accomplish your goals.
9/15/2014 20:17:41	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to Obama on building a strong economy. There are 49,500,000 people on food stamps. A historic record!
9/15/2014 20:11:30	Twitter Web Client	Obama’s promise to build an international coalition against ISIS is already broken. No one trusts him at home or abroad.
9/15/2014 13:59:08	Twitter Web Client	Good luck to the people of Scotland, whatever their decision may be on Thursday. The whole world is watching—really exciting!
9/15/2014 10:51:32	Twitter for Android	I will be on Fox and Friends at.7.00 A.M. Enjoy!
9/13/2014 23:54:43	Twitter for Android	I have nothing to do with Atlantic City-sold years ago (great timing). For losers and haters, I NEVER went bankrupt. Plus $10 billion, sorry
9/13/2014 23:38:14	Twitter for Android	Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game!
9/13/2014 22:54:03	Twitter for Android	Secretary Kerry cannot get other nations to join us in fighting ISIS. They are afraid and he is a poor salesman who reps a pathetic leader!
9/12/2014 20:04:22	Twitter Web Client	Sen. Kay Hagan voted for Amnesty &amp; ObamaCare. She is a proven liberal who recklessly goes along with Obama. Vote @ThomTillis in November!
9/12/2014 18:46:22	Twitter Web Client	The so-called ‘moderate’ Syrian rebels pledged their allegiance to ISIS after Obama’s address. We should not be arming them!
9/12/2014 11:13:54	Twitter for Android	The judge in the Oscar Pistorious case is a total moron. She said he didn't act like a killer. This is another O.J. disaster!
9/11/2014 12:35:23	Twitter for Android	They should have rebuilt the two buildings of the World Trade Center exactly as they were, except taller and stronger. A better statement!
9/11/2014 12:12:25	Twitter for Android	I can't believe that the judge in the Oscar Pistorious case has found him not guilty of murder. No one has been more guilty since O.J.!
9/11/2014 9:16:01	Twitter for Android	Can you believe that our very stupid politicians released the leader of ISIS and now we are spending billions trying to get him back!
9/11/2014 1:51:45	Twitter for Android	Tell Saudi Arabia and others that we want (demand!) free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private Boeing 747s.Pay up!
9/11/2014 1:31:06	Twitter for Android	Middle Eastern countries must participate militarily (no running away) and big league financially in order for us to go in and save them!
9/11/2014 1:27:39	Twitter for Android	I just want to know how much is Saudi Arabia and others who we are helping willing to pay for our saving from total extinction. Pay up now!
9/10/2014 21:22:02	Twitter Web Client	If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!
9/10/2014 1:22:18	Twitter for Android	I made a great deal of money in Atlantic City, but left years ago when I saw so many political mistakes being made. I have ZERO involvement!
9/9/2014 20:19:52	Twitter Web Client	Windmills are the greatest threat in the US to both bald and golden eagles. Media claims fictional ‘global warming’ is worse.
9/9/2014 19:53:05	Twitter Web Client	Why are we giving away our entire strategy and tactics we will deploy against ISIS? It puts our troops at a disadvantage.
9/9/2014 19:49:15	Twitter Web Client	Fact – Obama still has not fixed the backend of the ObamaCare website. This could be the greatest internet boondoggle in history.
9/9/2014 12:08:03	Twitter for Android	New poll states that a record number of Americans have lost all faith in President Obama - duh!

7/17/2014 14:13:52	Twitter Web Client	If Obama is concerned about the border, he should stop vacationing. Gov't will save millions which it can use to stop illegal migration.
7/17/2014 13:16:32	Twitter Web Client	Obama claims that he needs an extra $4B to secure the border. Well then he should not have wasted $5B on the ObamaCare website.

7/14/2014 23:05:14	Twitter for Android	Refloating the Costa Concordia for many hundreds of millions of $'s is ridiculous. Should have taken it apart in small pieces - save fortune
7/14/2014 22:40:00	Twitter for Android	It is a joke the amount of time that network news spends talking about the weather. No wonder their ratings are way down! Enough already.
7/14/2014 22:33:40	Twitter for Android	Record cold temperatures in July - 20 to 30 degrees colder than normal. What the hell happened to GLOBAL WARMING?

7/10/2014 18:09:09	Twitter Web Client	USMC Sgt. Tahmooressi sacrificed for our country. While Obama is welcoming illegals, our Marine is locked in a Mexican jail. #FreeOurMarine
7/10/2014 16:28:39	Twitter Web Client	Our gov’t should immediately stop sending $’s to Mexico, no friend, until they release Marine &amp; stop allowing immigrant inflow into U.S.
7/10/2014 16:04:20	Twitter Web Client	.@AlexSalmond I hope you played well at Royal Aberdeen but u must admit the windmill hovering over hole 14 is disgusting &amp; inappropriate.
7/10/2014 5:00:24	Twitter for Android	The most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago - and look what is happening there!
7/10/2014 4:48:34	Twitter for Android	Obama looks exhausted and beaten. He was never made or prepared for the job. Like it or not, he doesn't have "it"

7/9/2014 13:26:20	Twitter Web Client	There is only one person who should be crossing our southern border, USMC Sgt. Tahmooressi. Boycott Mexico? #FreeOurMarine
7/9/2014 13:24:43	Twitter Web Client	We should cut off all aid to every country that does not respect our border. Why are we giving them money in the first place?
7/9/2014 13:16:52	Twitter Web Client	If only the illegals were Tea Party members then Obama would get them out of the country immediately.

6/17/2014 20:42:40	Twitter Web Client	With our border not being secure, Obama is giving a pathway to terrorists to enter our country. An attack is on him.

6/16/2014 17:24:04	Twitter Web Client	If anybody else but Coore and Crenshaw designed Pinehurst they would be run out of town—(and the turtleback greens are totally unfair)!
6/16/2014 17:23:30	Twitter Web Client	The only reason I am critical of the Pinehurst look is because I’m a lover of golf—and that look on TV hurts golf badly.
6/16/2014 10:59:37	Twitter for Android	Will be doing Fox &amp; Friends at 7 - 2 minutes.
6/16/2014 0:16:49	Twitter for Android	@MattGinellaGC  Matt, you know nothing about quality golf or what it takes to make golf successful. You are all talk, no substance!
6/15/2014 23:40:35	Twitter for Android	@MattGinellaGCSadly Matt, you don't understand golf (even though you think you do).I have numerous couses that are far superior to Pinehurst
6/15/2014 23:35:06	Twitter for Android	@MattGinellaGC  I have watched Open Championships at Turnberry, one of the great golf courses of the World. Pinehurst not in the same league
6/15/2014 23:31:14	Twitter for Android	@MattGinellaGC  My position on Pinehurst is correct - bad for the game, a dried out cow pasture. You have no clue but keep trying!
6/15/2014 23:19:00	Twitter for Android	Johnny Miller correctly very critical of greens at Pinehurst. Said they should be "redone"
6/15/2014 22:44:33	Twitter for Android	I'd bet the horrible look of Pinehurst translates into poor television ratings. This is not what golf is about!

6/15/2014 2:28:02	Twitter for Android	.@MattGinellaGC  Have you ever seen Trump National/Bedminster or Trump International Golf links in Scotland. Both far better than Pinehurst!
6/15/2014 2:18:48	Twitter for Android	.@MattGinellaGC Matt, the statement about Pinehurst looking like a local community golf course,"awful", was not made by me but tweeted to me
6/15/2014 2:09:25	Twitter for Android	.@MattGinellaGC  It's true Matt, the NEW "Blue Monster" is better than Pinehurst, so is Bedminster. Turnberry &amp; Trump Aberdeen blow it away!
6/15/2014 0:10:06	Twitter for Android	I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U.S. left. What a terrible waste of lives and money!
6/14/2014 23:56:46	Twitter for Android	Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq, take over the country &amp; oil, and "O" will say thanks
6/14/2014 23:49:37	Twitter for Android	Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close! Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral.
6/14/2014 23:17:28	Twitter for Android	Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out. Actually, they will take over Iraq and all of their oil. Stupid U.S.

6/12/2014 12:07:32	Twitter for Android	I told all of the haters and losers long ago that Iraq would fall, take the OIL or get out fast! Massive waste of lives and trillions of $'s
6/12/2014 12:03:37	Twitter for Android	Iraq told us to get out, Iraq is now falling, and Iraq now wants us to come back! Don't do it unless we get the OIL, and I mean ALL OF IT!
6/12/2014 1:32:24	Twitter for Android	Iraq is falling apart fast - two trillion dollars and so many deaths - Bush got us in and Obama took far too long to get us out!

3/26/2014 12:42:13	Twitter for Android	By Obama mentioning Manhattan yesterday in his response, he has singlehandedly made it target #1. How totally stupid is this guy?
3/26/2014 9:11:39	Twitter for Android	This is the time for the United States to be strengthening all important military components - not rolling over and dealing from weakness!
3/26/2014 8:52:25	Twitter for Android	Not good or smart for Obama to be calling Russia a "regional" power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in NYC.
3/26/2014 8:46:47	Twitter for Android	President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in the Netherlands. He is not a natural leader, was never ment to lead - it is tough work for him

3/22/2014 11:31:51	Twitter for Android	Obama must now FOCUS, get his mind off "March.Madness", and LEAD! Watch Russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare!
3/22/2014 11:23:33	Twitter for Android	The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think - and could lead to World War III. WE NEED GREAT LEADERSHIP FAST

3/21/2014 0:14:28	Twitter for Android	While Putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the World, President Obama is watching March Madness (basketball)!

3/20/2014 5:48:23	Twitter for Android	Plane was carrying those terrible lithium ion batteries, which are highly combustible, as cargo. Fire could have started in cockpit.

10/24/2013 15:59:30	Twitter Web Client	You've got something unique to offer. Find out what it is. Ask yourself: What can I provide that does not yet exist?

10/23/2013 16:10:48	Twitter Web Client	Where’s the accountability for the $635M website fiasco in the Obama administration? Heads should roll and officials should be fired
10/23/2013 12:26:29	Twitter for Android	Why doesn't President Obama call upon the NSA to fix the badly broken website-then they could spy on all of the many cheaters &amp; arrest them!
10/23/2013 12:15:15	Twitter for Android	Honestly, whether you're for or against ObamaCare, the 635 million dollar website fiasco is bad for the U.S. It makes us look totally inept!
10/23/2013 0:21:56	Twitter for Android	Breaking news - The Washington Redskins have just announced that they will be removing the name Washington from their name!
10/22/2013 20:27:54	Twitter Web Client	If you want to succeed, keep your edge. Staying on top of all new developments in your sector = major advantage that pays dividends.
10/22/2013 20:12:12	Twitter Web Client	Have time to waste? Go to the ObamaCare website.
10/22/2013 19:54:48	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to receiving the T. Boone Pickens Entrepreneur Award at tomorrow’s @AmSpec Robert L. Bartley Gala dinner.
10/20/2013 22:52:43	Twitter for Android	I would bet that we have many great American technology companies that would build and fix the pathetic ObamaCare website for ZERO dollars!
10/20/2013 22:45:09	Twitter for Android	Why doesn't President Obama just get the people from Google to fix the failed   website. In fact, why didn't he use them in the first place!
10/20/2013 2:29:52	Twitter for Android	@NYMag   I hope everybody possible cancels their subscription to the failing, boring abd totally biased New York "Ragazine"-SAVE YOUR MONEY!

10/19/2013 21:33:45	Twitter for Android	@NYMag   In every interview New York Magazine has done for years they ask the same question - "What do you think of Donald Trump?" Beggars!
10/19/2013 21:23:47	Twitter for Android	@NYMag  Can you imagine a top editor at New York Magazine calling for my death-if they were responsible, he would be fired! Totally biased.
10/19/2013 21:13:15	Twitter for Android	@NYMag   Wow, numbers are really looking bad at  New York Magazine. While very boring, it is also very biased. Too bad, was once great!
10/19/2013 2:20:37	Twitter for Android	Just like its website, ObamaCare is a disaster.Maybe all those who are fighting it are wasting their time-it will fail on its own!
10/19/2013 1:43:27	Twitter for Android	Secy. Sebelius, who was responsible for the horrendous ObamaCare rollout, should resign or be fired.Refuses to go before Congress to explain
10/18/2013 20:06:54	Twitter Web Client	No wonder @NYMag is doing so poorly, with an idiot Sr. Editor like @DanAmira, it will only get worse!
10/18/2013 19:49:28	Twitter Web Client	Canadians kicked out the firm that the U.S. paid all that money to for the failed website. How stupid are our "leaders"? This is a scandal!
10/18/2013 19:48:24	Twitter for Android	Wow, China's growth accelerated 7.8% in third quarter.  If the U.S. had half that number we would be the talk of the World - need leadership
10/18/2013 19:21:57	Twitter Web Client	No surprise Saudis turned down spot on UN Security Council. They don’t want  responsibility. Just have us do their heavy lifting.
10/18/2013 18:27:13	Twitter Web Client	I love watching the dishonest writers @NYMag suffer the magazine’s failure.
10/18/2013 17:55:53	Twitter Web Client	Our country is being run by total amateurs. Let’s just call it “amateur hour.”

10/18/2013 11:19:32	Twitter for Android	ObamaCare website fiasco was a SINGLE bid to a Canadian company - terrible!
10/18/2013 11:01:52	Twitter for Android	I build beautiful websites with very smart and imaginative people for almost NOTHING. OUR GOVERNMENT SPENT ALMOST $535, 000, 000 for NOTHING
10/18/2013 10:48:20	Twitter for Android	The contract to build the ObamaCare website was given to a CANADIAN company for $55, 744, 081. It then bloated to $292, 071,067 INCOMPETENCE
10/18/2013 0:36:13	Twitter for Android	By the way, New York State MUST LOWER TAXES (and fast) and must start going after all of the "energy" that lies just below our feet (now)!
10/18/2013 0:29:00	Twitter for Android	Thanks for all of the great support but I just don't see myself wanting to run for Governor of New York - I have something else in mind!

10/15/2013 19:40:59	Twitter Web Client	Republicans seem intent on negotiating against themselves. Many senior Senators are doing Obama’s bidding. Can’t win this way.

10/14/2013 15:37:00	Twitter Web Client	As an addition, Apple must go to a larger screen now--asap! They're losing their standing in the market!
10/14/2013 14:40:26	Twitter Web Client	@AlyssaMenasci You have to have passion for your work. That's crucial. Then focus on it and don't give up.
10/14/2013 14:37:57	Twitter Web Client	@905K9 Keep the big picture in mind. There are always opportunities and possibilities, and thinking too small can negate a lot of them.

10/11/2013 16:07:50	Twitter Web Client	Why is Douglas Durst allowed to use the World Trade Center to get out of a lease with Conde Nast?
10/11/2013 14:38:39	Twitter Web Client	I wouldn’t use @Richard_Meier to design a doghouse, let alone a house or building!
10/11/2013 14:37:57	Twitter Web Client	@Richard_Meier, a highly overrated architect, has had many problems with buildings he designed downtown--&amp; others!
10/11/2013 14:36:52	Twitter Web Client	Lightweight @AGSchneiderman is pushing for the Moreland Commission to be disbanded immediately—because he is being looked at!
10/11/2013 13:06:22	Twitter for Android	Jack Welch thinks Sam Palmisano, retired CEO of IBM, should be the next CEO of MICROSOFT. Interesting!

10/10/2013 19:03:50	Twitter Web Client	Obama has called @GOP terrorists during this showdown. It’s a shame he really doesn’t think it because then he would meet all @GOP demands.
10/10/2013 17:58:19	Twitter Web Client	The fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. - Sen. Obama, 3/16/06
10/10/2013 17:36:48	Twitter Web Client	Obama’s job approval is at 37%, a record low. @GOP &amp; @SpeakerBoehner have the leverage &amp; momentum. Delay ObamaCare for all Americans!
10/10/2013 16:37:25	Twitter Web Client	Obama can open the Mall for illegals to protest our country yet he continues to barricade WWII memorial. That’s an absolute disgrace.
10/9/2013 20:10:32	Twitter Web Client	Re Florida Power &amp; Light—Most important is safety but they have to also cater to aesthetics &amp; not ruin the beauty of Florida.
10/9/2013 20:10:15	Twitter Web Client	I pay millions of $’s a year to Florida Power &amp; Light &amp; they can’t give us what we want. Maybe a major class action suit against them?
10/9/2013 18:27:46	Twitter Web Client	Entrepreneurs who develop their Midas Touch do not work for money. They work to create or acquire assets. Focus on assets.
10/9/2013 11:45:46	Twitter for Android	If the U.S. Government doesn't give the money necessary for the burials of our military personnel, I will.The U.S. under Obama's leadership!
10/9/2013 11:39:18	Twitter for Android	It is outrageous and disgusting that families of U.S. MILITARY personnel killed in action will not be given money for burials. SAD!
10/9/2013 8:59:10	Twitter for Android	With President Obama it's all talk and no action. Our country is in desperate need of smart and decisive leadership before it is too late!
10/8/2013 23:34:59	Twitter for Android	I'm just so tired of listening to the same old rhetoric and words, day after day, from our President. It's time to stop talking-WORK!
10/8/2013 21:11:22	Twitter Web Client	Florida Power &amp; Light has disgusting rotting utility poles outside Doral in Miami. They should put in new ones or will be sued.
10/8/2013 21:11:03	Twitter Web Client	In my opinion, one of the worst utility companies in the country is Florida Power and Light.
10/8/2013 20:34:20	Twitter Web Client	Did you ever think our country would  become an economic basket case? So much for Hope &amp; Change.
10/8/2013 20:30:11	Twitter Web Client	Had a great time on @gretawire’s inaugural 7PM show. Congrats to Greta  on the new spot!

10/8/2013 15:30:16	Twitter Web Client	Expect the best from people. They will rise to the challenge and  it's important to inspire confidence.
10/8/2013 13:19:29	Twitter for Android	President Obama wants to change the name of the "White House" because it is highly discriminating and not at all politically correct!
10/8/2013 13:09:46	Twitter for Android	President should not be telling the Washington Redskins to change their name-our country has far bigger problems! FOCUS on them,not nonsense
10/7/2013 21:05:58	Twitter Web Client	My sense is that people are far angrier at the President than they are at Congress re the shutdown—an interesting turn!
10/7/2013 20:42:54	Twitter Web Client	With the debt limit approaching, @GOP has even more leverage. If they stay united and on message they can win.
10/7/2013 19:58:43	Twitter Web Client	83% of the government is still running during the shutdown while 41% of nondefense federal workers are furloughed. Room for cuts.
10/7/2013 18:32:44	Twitter Web Client	Obama is tougher on WWII vets wanting to visit a DC memorial than Iran. He needs to show respect to our vets and not play games.
10/7/2013 17:52:15	Twitter Web Client	Government is shut down yet Obama is now harassing the privately owned @Redskins to change its name.He needs to focus on his job!
10/7/2013 16:38:08	Twitter Web Client	Standing strong for his people, @GovWalker is ignoring the Feds and keeping all Wisconsin parks open. Great!

10/4/2013 19:18:24	Twitter Web Client	While the Pres. of Iran tweets sweet nothings to Obama he forbids the Iranians to use twitter. Very revealing.

10/4/2013 17:42:32	Twitter Web Client	Total misnomer to call ObamaCare ‘The Affordable Care Act.’ Affordable for whom besides big businesses &amp; Congress w/their exemptions?

10/2/2013 18:33:40	Twitter Web Client	The ObamaCare disaster is in full swing. Websites are down, people can’t sign up and elderly can’t understand the lingo.
10/2/2013 18:12:07	Twitter Web Client	When it comes to Iran's nuclear weapons program, here's my advice: Distrust, dismantle and verify. - @IsraeliPM @netanyahu

10/2/2013 11:52:17	Twitter for iPhone	Can you imagine, with all of the talk about ObamaCare, technical breakdowns made it a disastrous day. Our government is badly broken!
10/1/2013 19:53:09	Twitter Web Client	It is crucial for Republicans to remain united during this shutdown
10/1/2013 19:50:35	Twitter Web Client	There have been 17 shutdowns since 1976, 14 under Reagan and Bush with Democrat Congresses who wanted more spending.
10/1/2013 18:47:42	Twitter Web Client	It was an honor to be @GretchenCarlson's inaugural guest on her new show ‘The Real Story.’ Gretchen will be a big success!
10/1/2013 18:21:43	Twitter Web Client	Obama has not passed a single budget in 4 years. Democrats don’t even vote them in Congress. He has failed to lead!
10/1/2013 18:19:49	Twitter Web Client	Obama &amp; the Democrats want this shutdown. They think it helps their electoral prospects for 2014. Don’t believe!
10/1/2013 14:36:57	Twitter Web Client	Achievers move forward at all times. Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.
10/1/2013 10:27:42	Twitter for Android	The Republicans can absolutely win if they stick together-but they are NOT sticking together. Sen. McCain just said "we can't win".Very bad!
9/30/2013 12:34:12	Twitter for Android	@DanyellaAngel  Thank you Danyella-if you would like to work there call Jackie in my office (NY).
9/29/2013 11:06:42	Twitter for Android	With proper thinking and leadership, we can have a much better plan than Obamacare - something that works for the people and costs much less
9/29/2013 11:00:20	Twitter for Android	Obamacare is far toooo expensive, far toooo complicated (thousands of pages) and, most importantly, doesn't work. WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER!
9/27/2013 23:46:10	Twitter for Android	Iran is toying with our president - buying time and laughing at the stupidity of our leadership. Syria, and now this! What's next?
9/27/2013 19:10:25	Twitter Web Client	Re negotiation: Know exactly what you want and keep it to yourself. Think about what the other side wants and where they're coming from.
9/27/2013 18:12:00	Twitter Web Client	Don’t believe the manipulated job numbers. Walmart has just cut orders with suppliers because of rising inventory.
9/27/2013 16:55:35	Twitter Web Client	On Monday, ObamaCare kicks in with all goodies of 300% increased premiums, higher taxes and part-time replacement employees.
9/27/2013 15:51:15	Twitter Web Client	Our country needs leadership now. There is total dysfunction in Washington.

9/25/2013 17:49:25	Twitter Web Client	Obama wanted to meet with the Iranian president, yet the Iranians denied the request. So much for Hope &amp; Change.
9/25/2013 17:44:06	Twitter Web Client	Remember what I previously said--Obama will someday attack Iran in order to show how tough he is.
9/25/2013 17:42:33	Twitter Web Client	Can you believe the head of Iran refused to meet with our great President?—Zero respect!
9/25/2013 16:01:23	Twitter Web Client	If Justice Roberts had made the correct decision on ObamaCare, our country would not be in turmoil right now!
9/25/2013 0:28:15	Twitter for Android	@NeNeLeakes   NeNe asks me for advice and I am happy to oblige. Tonight at 9.00 on Bravo (and watch her ratings go through the roof!).
9/24/2013 19:36:41	Twitter Web Client	It’s a shame the ruling class of Republicans don’t attack Obama and the Democrats the way they hit Senators Cruz &amp; Lee.
9/24/2013 18:10:53	Twitter Web Client	Obama told the UN that “the world is more stable than it was 5 years ago.” Is he delusional?

9/6/2013 13:02:13	Twitter for Android	I wonder how much our "leaders" have promised, or given, Russia in order for them to behave and not make the U.S. look even worse?
9/6/2013 12:55:26	Twitter for Android	Really bad news just announced concerning jobs. Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated. Interest rates, therefore, to remain low.

9/5/2013 11:13:51	Twitter for Android	The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix U.S.A.
9/5/2013 11:07:34	Twitter for Android	President Obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about Syria crossing the RED LINE. Amazingly, now he denies he said that!

9/4/2013 1:52:00	Twitter for Android	The great GENERALS MacArthur and Patton, real leaders and fighters, are spinning in their graves as we give Syria info &amp; time to prepare.
9/3/2013 19:41:45	Twitter Web Client	How can General Martin Dempsey tell Obama that delaying the Syria bombardment will have no consequences? He is no Patton or MacArthur.
9/3/2013 18:48:47	Twitter Web Client	China, OPEC and Russia laugh at us. But now thanks to Obama so does Syria. Very sad!
9/3/2013 11:28:44	Twitter for Android	President Obama's "Arab Spring" is not looking so good right now!
9/3/2013 1:58:38	Twitter for Android	Think of it, the Arab League doesn't want to get involved with Syria - but they want us to do their dirty work. How stupid!

9/2/2013 2:20:29	Twitter for Android	Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops? They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves!
9/2/2013 2:15:19	Twitter for Android	The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria, but they want us to attack.Are our leaders insane or just stupid
9/1/2013 10:57:02	Twitter for Android	It is truly amateur hour at the White House - and this is why we should not be doing the "war thing" right now!
9/1/2013 10:48:29	Twitter for Android	President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria!
8/31/2013 9:46:07	Twitter for Android	Be prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III.

5/11/2013 21:03:38	Twitter for Android	@mcuban is a short ball hitter who had a massive failure on television, The Benefactor. Now he is one of many on a modest ratings show, S T.

5/3/2013 16:39:12	Twitter Web Client	Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is a total phony –he should cherish his past—not run from it.
5/3/2013 16:37:49	Twitter Web Client	If Jon Stewart is so above it all &amp; legit, why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz? He should be proud of his heritage!
5/3/2013 16:37:00	Twitter Web Client	What’s funny about the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” -- it was not coined by Jon Leibowitz-- he stole it from some moron on twitter.

4/24/2013 11:19:10	Twitter for Android	Lance Armstrong just got sued by the Federal Government-they want their money back-I told you so! What was he thinking when he did that int?
4/24/2013 11:12:27	Twitter for Android	Scotland does not have free press, even when you are just stating the facts-it's crazy!
4/24/2013 11:08:13	Twitter for Android	@ruralbeeffarmer   Big pollution during manufacturing and building process!
4/24/2013 8:47:22	Twitter for Android	@RebeccaErin_   They were viciously attacking other people in the Park-nice guys?
4/24/2013 8:34:56	Twitter for Android	I have many great people but also an amazing number of haters and losers responding to my tweets-why do these lowlifes follow-nothing to do!
4/24/2013 7:34:09	Twitter for Android	The Central Park Five documentary  was a one sided piece of garbage that didn't explain the.horrific crimes of these young men while in park
4/24/2013 7:24:20	Twitter for Android	@bitchforshort  Victim never died so they would not have been given death penalty-but did you see what these "innocent" boys were doing?
4/24/2013 1:49:57	Twitter for Android	The Chinese talk of climate change and carbon footprint but don't clean up their factories-but they sell us the equipment to clean up ours!
4/24/2013 1:45:34	Twitter for Android	Wrong, used to be called global warming and when that name didn't work, they deftly changed it to climate change-because it's freezing!
4/24/2013 0:32:05	Twitter for Android	@HelmJoshua   Wind turbines will quadruple your electric bills and destroy the value of your home. Lot's of chicken soup however-bird kill.
4/22/2013 20:57:02	Twitter Web Client	If your enemies end up liking you it’s because they beat you.  You want their respect, not their friendship.
4/22/2013 20:31:24	Twitter Web Client	Next time you are waiting in an emergency room remember the Boston killer was rushed to intensive care within minutes of capture.
4/22/2013 20:15:29	Twitter Web Client	Will Barack Obama personally read the Boston terrorist his Miranda Rights?
4/22/2013 19:41:26	Twitter Web Client	.@THEGaryBusey survives another week of All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC. Gary is shifty and playing to win.
4/22/2013 18:50:21	Twitter Web Client	In light of Boston, immigration legislation will be much harder to get.
4/22/2013 18:15:08	Twitter Web Client	.@BrandenRoderick did a great job on All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC.  Raised a lot of money for charity while looking great.
4/22/2013 16:22:36	Twitter Web Client	The Boston killer will soon be asking for a Presidential pardon—don’t give it to him, Mr. President—hang tough!
4/22/2013 16:13:30	Twitter Web Client	The big problem for little @MacMiller is that he’s going to have to have another hit song, not just his Donald Trump bonanza.
4/22/2013 16:13:16	Twitter Web Client	.@MacMiller has over 79M hits on YouTube &amp; just hit platinum with his Donald Trump song—screw you Mac!

4/22/2013 2:58:52	Twitter Web Client	What did you think of the boardroom? #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 2:44:05	Twitter Web Client	George also appeared on Saturday Night Live when I was guest host in 2004. A great time! #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 2:34:41	Twitter Web Client	George Ross and I have done some great real estate deals together. He’s a tough negotiator. #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 2:32:15	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to @THEGaryBusey's book of "Buseyisms"!
4/22/2013 2:21:16	Twitter Web Client	Romance or Adventure- what do you prefer? #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 2:19:12	Twitter Web Client	For you newcomers, George Ross was one of my first advisors on the original Apprentice. #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 1:56:32	Twitter Web Client	This assignment has been a challenge to both teams. #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 1:45:43	Twitter Web Client	This assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of @lisarinna and @pennjillette. #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 1:41:08	Twitter Web Client	George Ross could be right—@THEGaryBusey would be better in the adventure task than the romance task. #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 1:35:37	Twitter Web Client	.@TraceAdkins isn’t excited about their ideas. Are you? #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 1:33:01	Twitter Web Client	.@THEGaryBusey is making no attempt to help. Is he in BuseyLand? Their team is short on help already… #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 1:19:56	Twitter Web Client	How stressed are @lisarinna and @pennjillette already? #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 1:13:50	Mobile Web (M5)	I hope you are watching the Apprentice...tonight's show is great and Brett Michaels is back!
4/22/2013 1:11:04	Twitter Web Client	Everybody loves @bretmichaels! He’s a great champion and this is where he should be. He agrees!
4/22/2013 1:09:25	Twitter Web Client	.@bretmichaels and George Ross are back as advisors. Good to see them! #CelebApprentice
4/22/2013 1:07:32	Twitter Web Client	.@TraceAdkins presents the NJ Coast Red Cross a $40,000 check for Sandy Relief. You can tell he’s very pleased about that--&amp; rightly so.
4/22/2013 1:02:30	Twitter Web Client	Seems like the teams are surprised when @THEGaryBusey comes back. #CelebApprentice
4/21/2013 21:46:19	Mobile Web (M5)	What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? I suspect he may talk!
4/21/2013 21:34:49	Mobile Web (M5)	Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. Once he is well he will say, "speak to my lawyers."
4/21/2013 21:04:18	Mobile Web (M5)	Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it!
4/21/2013 21:00:28	Mobile Web (M5)	I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.
4/21/2013 20:57:20	Mobile Web (M5)	Great sportscaster Al Michaels, a friend of mine, played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National, LA. He was in perfect shape!
4/21/2013 15:55:45	Twitter for Android	If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand!
4/21/2013 15:47:49	Twitter for Android	NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards!
4/21/2013 15:38:07	Twitter for Android	Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms, legs and worse!
4/21/2013 15:34:19	Twitter for Android	Bullshit-Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill.
4/21/2013 14:11:24	Twitter for Android	You are right, the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer!
4/21/2013 14:05:47	Twitter for Android	I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense
4/21/2013 13:56:48	Twitter for Android	Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away?  We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH
4/21/2013 13:52:17	Twitter for Android	When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals, remember the killings-maimings
4/21/2013 13:40:45	Twitter for Android	I hate when the news media, so afraid to offend anyone, always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as "the suspect".
4/21/2013 13:32:51	Twitter for Android	The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass
4/21/2013 13:26:58	Twitter for Android	I just won a big Court decision (N.Y. Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties.
4/21/2013 13:17:10	Twitter for Android	Oh no, they are worried that they didn't read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish?  t
4/20/2013 13:12:25	Twitter for Android	Sorry,  the best and most beautiful ties and shirts made anywhere and at a really reasonable cost. Also, fragrance is amazing. GO TO MACY'S.
4/20/2013 1:30:15	Twitter for Android	Great job by the FBI, Boston Police and all others involved-start the trial tonight!
4/20/2013 1:00:42	Twitter for Android	Is the Boston killer eligible for Obama Care to bring him back to health?
4/20/2013 0:53:38	Twitter for Android	Read my tweets you dopes-of course he should get a trial-but fast (not a 12 year disaster).
4/20/2013 0:35:59	Twitter for Android	You must be kidding-zero chance he is innocent!
4/19/2013 23:56:40	Twitter for Android	Get ALL the info,  then quick trial, then death penalty for the Boston killer of innocent children and people! Do not be kind.
4/17/2013 20:48:17	Twitter Web Client	Thinking small when you could think big limits you in all aspects of your life.
4/17/2013 19:57:21	Twitter Web Client	Druggie A-Rod, @MLB’s biggest fraud, is lucky George Steinbrenner is no longer with us.  @Yankees would have voided his contract.
4/17/2013 19:05:20	Twitter Web Client	It is terrible that neither Obama, Biden nor Kerry attended Lady Thatcher’s funeral. They would all run to Muslim Brotherhood Morsi’s.
4/17/2013 19:02:41	Twitter Web Client	Business is easy. Dealing with people is hard. If you are an entrepreneur, your most important job is to choose who works with you.
4/17/2013 18:05:38	Twitter Web Client	The Chinese must still be laughing at Kerry’s trip to China.  He got nothing, gave them everything and promised even more.
4/17/2013 16:54:27	Twitter Web Client	Had a fantastic time at yesterday’s All-Star @ApprenticeNBC press conference with @StephenBaldwin7 in @TrumpTowerNY.
4/17/2013 16:24:05	Twitter Web Client	Great to see @RedSox win big yesterday. Good for Boston and the country. Yesterday we were all @RedSox fans.
4/17/2013 13:17:34	Twitter Web Client	@LarryRobertWyat Our country needs a negotiator--we are failing fast!
4/16/2013 20:45:55	Twitter Web Client	I sure hope the sexting pervert Anthony Weiner runs for mayor.  Will be great fun watching him both lose and be humiliated.
4/16/2013 19:07:38	Twitter Web Client	Negotiation is persuasion more than power. Be reasonable and flexible, and never let anyone know exactly where you’re coming from.
4/16/2013 18:44:43	Twitter Web Client	.@alexsalmond  RT @islandbluenose You'll be doing us in scotland a great service if you win. Good Luck.
4/16/2013 17:14:52	Twitter Web Client	The world economy is under deep stress with growth slowing everywhere.  Yet crude is over $87/barrel. Should be $25 at the most.
4/16/2013 17:03:44	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @Boston_Police, @FBIBoston &amp; all emergency first responders &amp; doctors for their excellent work under fire yesterday
4/16/2013 15:39:12	Twitter Web Client	@AscotCarRental  I know Adam--he's a great player &amp; great guy!
4/16/2013 15:35:16	Twitter Web Client	It’s very sad that the administration isn’t sending anyone to Margaret Thatcher’s funeral. She was a big U.S. supporter.
4/16/2013 14:30:46	Twitter Web Client	I’ve known @hardball_chris for a long time &amp; sadly, he gets dumber each &amp; every year--&amp; started from a very low base.
4/16/2013 14:29:57	Twitter Web Client	.@hardball_chris  Did you forget about Bill Ayers &amp; so many others? You should apologize to all the people you offended yesterday.
4/16/2013 14:19:46	Twitter Web Client	.@hardball_chris must have the lowest IQ on television—now telling people that domestic terrorists are from the right.
4/15/2013 2:59:06	Twitter Web Client	Do you think I made the right decision? #CelebApprentice
4/15/2013 2:53:33	Twitter Web Client	Who do you think is going home? #CelebApprentice
4/15/2013 2:42:06	Twitter Web Client	Product integration is very important. #CelebApprentice
4/15/2013 2:32:39	Twitter Web Client	I’m impressed -- both teams have produced very entertaining silent films. #CelebApprentice
4/15/2013 2:29:33	Twitter Web Client	Great shots of @TrumpTowerNY #CelebApprentice
4/15/2013 2:24:10	Twitter Web Client	Do you know how many years @TheRealMarilu starred on Taxi? #CelebApprentice
4/15/2013 2:22:35	Twitter Web Client	What is your favorite @THEGaryBusey film? Tonight's short film? Point Break? Lethal Weapon? #CelebApprentice
4/15/2013 2:16:53	Twitter Web Client	It's boardroom time! Does anyone miss @OMAROSA? #CelebApprentice
4/15/2013 2:02:26	Twitter Web Client	.@PennJillette and @StephenBaldwin7's arguments are making the edit room look like the boardroom. #CelebApprentice
4/15/2013 1:55:35	Twitter Web Client	Based on the shoots- which silent film do you think will be better? #CelebApprentice
4/14/2013 23:53:45	Twitter for Android	@adamscott - I am really proud of you Adam - I'll see you soon at Trump National Doral!
4/14/2013 23:43:08	Twitter for Android	Great job @AdamScott - you deserve it!
4/14/2013 22:38:30	Twitter for Android	Make sure to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at  9 on NBC. A GREAT SHOW, JUST LIKE THE MASTERS.   9
4/14/2013 11:40:16	Twitter for Android	Remember, save your evening to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 - increased to a full two hours - great episode - watch Gary B.
4/13/2013 23:29:03	Twitter for Android	South Korea must in some form pay for our help-the U.S. must stop being stupid!
4/13/2013 23:24:45	Twitter for Android	China will extract much from Secretary Kerry and the U:S. in order for them to help us with the North Korea problem-don't let this happen!
4/13/2013 21:15:33	Twitter for Android	Did A Rod really try to buy the papers that would implicate him re. drugs - wow, that would be the end, a disaster!
4/13/2013 11:48:03	Twitter for Android	Remember, NBC increased Celebrity Apprentice to 2 hours starting this Sunday night at 9 P.M. through end of season-great news for App lovers
4/13/2013 11:25:37	Twitter for Android	Bad break for @TigerWoods-hits a great shot which hits the pin and kicks into the water-gets a bogey on hole with another great shot-Champ!
4/13/2013 11:13:40	Twitter for Android	What a shame that Kobe Bryant was so badly injured last night - a truly great champion who brought the Lakers back from oblivion this year!
4/13/2013 3:55:47	Twitter for Android	Ridiculous that they gave the 14 year old golfer from China a one stroke penalty for slow play at The Masters(see, I can stick up for China)
4/12/2013 11:38:18	Twitter for Android	Don't talk to me about Bush, I was never a defender or a fan!
4/12/2013 11:29:49	Twitter for Android	I can't believe we are not asking South Korea for anything. They make a fortune on us while we spend a fortune defending them-how stupid!
4/11/2013 20:31:51	Twitter Web Client	Mr. President, it is time to lead on the Korean crisis.  Make a statement from the Rose Garden and send a strong message to the man child!
4/11/2013 18:47:08	Twitter Web Client	The time has come. THEGaryBusey will be project mgr on this Sunday's All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC. MUST SEE TV!!! Back to 2 hrs.
4/11/2013 17:58:10	Twitter Web Client	.@Jimmyv3  @WWE Greatly appreciate your nice words re WrestleMania. That’s why you are such a respected writer.
4/11/2013 17:55:37	Twitter Web Client	I really liked everyone at the @WWE Hall of Fame ceremony--fantastic people!
4/11/2013 17:43:36	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @nyknicks on winning their first Atlantic Division title since 1994. @carmeloanthony is a great New Yorker and Knick!
4/11/2013 17:38:06	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @IvankaTrump and Jared on the big news.  I will have yet another grandchild this fall!
4/11/2013 17:18:14	Twitter Web Client	Opportunities only present themselves if you are out there looking for them.  Be aggressive and seize them when they come.
4/11/2013 17:02:42	Twitter Web Client	.@alexsalmond @pressjournal  RT @rdowns @realdonaldtrump Margaret Thatcher NEVER would have allowed those wind mill monstrosities.
4/11/2013 10:10:28	Twitter for Android	I feel so badly for Mark Cuban-the Dallas Mavericks were just eliminated from the playoffs and his partners are pissed. Very sad!
4/10/2013 11:42:32	Twitter for Android	I hope everyone (especially the haters and losers) goes to Macy's today and buys some DJT ties, shirts and suits-and SUCCESS Fragrance-love!
4/10/2013 10:25:31	Twitter for Android	Sorry losers and haters, but I LOVED the great energy in Madison Square Garden during my speech. The WWE thought it was incredible - it was!
4/10/2013 10:18:26	Twitter for Android	Why did Vince and the WWE give my speech and segment the most time last night on USA Network - because that's what people want to see!
4/9/2013 23:19:01	Twitter for Android	Yea, NBC has increased all remaining Celebrity Apprentice episodes to two hours starting at 9 P.M. on Sunday!  Amazing show.
4/9/2013 20:09:16	Twitter Web Client	It’s Tuesday, how much has China stolen from us today through cyber espionage?
4/8/2013 21:49:55	Twitter Web Client	I just left @trumpwinery in Charlottesville,Virginia --- it is the finest in the country--- really incredible!
4/8/2013 20:22:37	Twitter Web Client	Don't negate your own power. Whatever you've been dealt, know you can deal with it. Fear is the opposite of faith.
4/8/2013 20:21:15	Twitter Web Client	Think positively. There are always opportunities. Keep your focus and don't give up!
4/8/2013 19:53:09	Twitter Web Client	The new reality. ‘China Daily’ is sold in street newspaper vending machines across DC. Why not? They own the place.
4/8/2013 19:46:52	Twitter Web Client	Margaret Thatcher was the Iron Lady of the West. She promoted freedom &amp; democracy---a great leader &amp; ally of America.
4/8/2013 18:36:36	Twitter Web Client	I am very impressed by @dennisrodman. His return to this season’s @ApprenticeNBC  showed who Dennis really is--which is very good.

4/8/2013 2:25:18	Twitter Web Client	What do you think so far? #CelebApprentice
4/8/2013 2:10:25	Twitter Web Client	It appears that @THEGaryBusey is entranced with @MELANIATRUMP- and rightly so! #CelebApprentice

4/5/2013 17:54:04	Twitter Web Client	Only 88,000 jobs were added this past March. Prediction was 190,000. Businesses can’t expand with Obama Care &amp; high taxes on horizon.
4/5/2013 17:40:13	Twitter Web Client	...Who says the death penalty is not a deterrent?
4/5/2013 17:40:06	Twitter Web Client	James Holmes, the Aurora, Colorado guy who killed 12 people &amp; injured 58 others, is fighting hard to avoid the death penalty...
4/5/2013 16:03:31	Twitter Web Client	Tell me, which is “cooler”—my induction into the @WWE Hall of Fame or my Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?
4/5/2013 16:02:47	Twitter Web Client	Very exciting—tomorrow night at Madison Square Garden I get inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame.
4/5/2013 13:42:06	Twitter for Android	Jobs report is really bad - beyond the worst projections.A bad day on Wall Street!

4/5/2013 13:08:46	Twitter for Android	North Korea can't survive, or even eat, without the help of China. China could solve this problem with one phone call-they love taunting us!

3/30/2013 11:33:42	Twitter for Android	North Korea is reliant on China. China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.

3/21/2013 17:28:34	Twitter Web Client	Yes, All-Star @ApprenticeNBC contestant @THEGaryBusey is a little out there. But he uses his ‘uniqueness’ to his advantage.
3/21/2013 16:39:44	Twitter Web Client	It won’t stay a buyer’s market forever. If you can, take advantage and buy property asap. You’ll thank me!
3/21/2013 16:12:47	Twitter Web Client	Remember the golden rule of negotiating: He who has the gold makes the rules.
3/21/2013 14:25:06	Twitter Web Client	It’s snowing &amp; freezing in NYC. What the hell ever happened to global warming?
3/21/2013 13:47:20	Twitter Web Client	.@mcuban  Mark—nice picture, thanks for the invite to the Mavs/Nets game. Next time I’ll go and you’ll win!

3/20/2013 21:53:06	Twitter Web Client	Haters, stop saying I went bankrupt, it is not so. I never went bankrupt...
3/20/2013 21:53:03	Twitter Web Client	... but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage.
3/20/2013 21:50:40	Twitter Web Client	For the haters, out of hundreds of deals or transactions, I have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals.
3/20/2013 21:47:18	Twitter Web Client	Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
3/20/2013 21:47:14	Twitter Web Client	... Icahn, Kravis, Apollo and most others--but nobody says they went bankrupt!
3/20/2013 21:45:22	Twitter Web Client	People buy deals &amp; immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals...
3/20/2013 21:45:19	Twitter Web Client	... It is very effective and a commonly used business tool.
3/20/2013 21:41:44	Twitter Web Client	Why do the losers &amp; haters always say I wear a “wig” when they know I don’t.  Like it or not, it’s all mine—just ask Barbara Walters.
3/20/2013 21:11:10	Twitter Web Client	My shirts, ties &amp; suits (and fragrance, Success) are doing great -- go over &amp; check out Macy’s now—beautiful new selection!
3/20/2013 20:54:30	Twitter Web Client	. @OMAROSA is smart and strategic. People should cut her some slack and respect the way she works on @ApprenticeNBC.
3/20/2013 20:20:42	Twitter Web Client	. @WWE’s @WrestleMania XXIX less than 3 weeks away.  Looking forward to being inducted into the Hall of Fame!
3/20/2013 19:22:49	Twitter Web Client	The NFL has just barred ball carriers from using helmet as contact.  What is happening to the sport? The beginning of the end.

3/20/2013 19:05:57	Twitter Web Client	Board Room finale of this week’s All-Star @ApprenticeNBC will leave viewers wondering where the rest of the season goes…It's great!
3/20/2013 18:58:43	Twitter Web Client	It’s a shame to hear that the @dcexaminer is failing. No one wants the paper, even if it is being handed out for free.
3/20/2013 18:33:31	Twitter Web Client	@yokoono John was great--everybody misses him. Best wishes.
3/20/2013 18:14:22	Twitter Web Client	.@NBC just announced that all 1 hour @CelebApprentice episodes are being expanded to 2 hours—it’s amazing what good ratings will do!
3/20/2013 18:01:42	Twitter Web Client	I remained strong for @TigerWoods during his difficult period. He rewarded me (and himself) by winning at Trump National Doral.
3/20/2013 17:59:19	Twitter Web Client	.@SouthJerseyMag, “According to the Pros” just named Trump National Golf Club, Philadelphia, the #1 private club. Thanks!
3/20/2013 15:44:35	Twitter Web Client	.@hardball_chris’ very small audience is shrinking rapidly because people finally understand that he is very very dumb!
3/19/2013 22:43:38	Twitter Web Client	You can have the best product in the world, but if people don't know about it, it's not going to be worth much.  The Art of The Deal
3/19/2013 21:47:51	Twitter Web Client	.@mcuban  Mark, okay with me but don't start your bullshit again!
3/19/2013 20:45:18	Twitter Web Client	Passion motivates. Passionate people don't give up; their zeal eliminates fear. Passion can also create business opportunities.
3/19/2013 20:09:09	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @Likud_Party MK @dannydanon on being offered Deputy Defense Minister of IDF by @IsraeliPM @netanyahu.
3/19/2013 20:08:05	Twitter Web Client	If you’re sitting in an office working in a job you hate, then it’s time to THINK BIG and plan your next step…
3/19/2013 19:20:49	Twitter Web Client	10 yrs ago today, the Iraq war began. 4,485 of our nation’s finest have not returned home alive. Iran will soon control Iraq &amp; its oil.
3/19/2013 19:19:18	Twitter Web Client	Amnesty is suicide for Republicans.Not one of those 12 million who broke our laws will vote Republican.Obama is laughing at @GOP.
3/19/2013 18:47:33	Twitter Web Client	.@RNC report was written by the ruling class of consultants who blew the election. Short on ideas. Just giving excuses to donors.
3/19/2013 18:45:47	Twitter Web Client	One of the most obvious lessons on @ApprenticeNBC is for the candidates to learn to think quickly. - Think Like a Champion
3/19/2013 18:21:42	Twitter Web Client	Does anyone remember the fight @mcuban had w/ the referee—he was weak &amp; pathetic—a non-athlete trying to live life thru his players.
3/19/2013 18:13:14	Twitter Web Client	Why do shows have @ananavarro—Ntl Hispanic Chair for the losing McCain ’08 &amp; Huntsman ’12.  She’s a loser who doesn’t deliver votes.
3/19/2013 18:08:25	Twitter Web Client	Sorry folks, but Donald Trump is far richer and much better looking than dopey @mcuban!
3/19/2013 17:51:08	Twitter Web Client	All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC continues to surprise our loyal viewers each and every week. More, and bigger, coming…
3/19/2013 17:48:01	Twitter Web Client	It was just announced that @ErinBurnett won’t be going to mornings on CNN. @OutFrontCNN just made a wise decision.
3/19/2013 17:39:14	Twitter Web Client	.@SarahPalinUSA did a great job @CPACnews. Much of what she said was plain old "common sense."
3/19/2013 17:36:34	Twitter Web Client	.@hardball_chris became a super liberal Obama fan only because he must need the money--and on @MSNBC that’s the way it is.
3/19/2013 17:11:21	Twitter Web Client	.@ErinBurnett should have stayed at CNBC—she was never smart, but people liked her. @OutFrontCNN Jeff Zucker’s got problems!
3/19/2013 16:48:29	Twitter Web Client	For beauty and flight, I’ll take the @Boeing 757 over the @Boeing 787 any day!
3/19/2013 16:48:26	Twitter Web Client	l still think @Boeing should just bite the bullet &amp; get rid of the new batteries in the 787. Those batteries will always be a problem!
3/19/2013 15:46:03	Twitter Web Client	I don’t like seeing the Pope standing at the checkout counter (front desk) of a hotel in order to pay his bill. It’s not Pope-like!
3/19/2013 15:38:54	Twitter Web Client	.@hardball_chris  is a really dumb guy(and I know him well)—that’s why he works swimmingly with our leaders in Washington.
3/19/2013 14:09:18	Twitter Web Client	Re: CPAC “The crowd in the main room filled to capacity by the end of Trump’s address, something his operative said he planned to do...
3/19/2013 14:09:15	Twitter Web Client	.... to help McConnell, who spoke right after him.”@BreitbartNews
3/19/2013 13:53:49	Twitter Web Client	I was sorry to decline headlining the Reagan Dinner last Saturday due to a prior business commitment. Pres. Reagan was one of the greats.
3/19/2013 13:52:41	Twitter Web Client	.@rushlimbaugh played 3 separate audio bites (the most of anyone) of my CPAC speech. Hour 3 in Friday's show.
3/19/2013 13:51:07	Twitter Web Client	Be weak on immigration and ensure Democratic victory.
3/19/2013 13:51:00	Twitter Web Client	.@rushlimbaugh is right—the Republicans lost because they weren’t conservative enough—or tough enough.
3/19/2013 13:17:49	Twitter for Android	But @mcuban is physically weak, he has no clubhead speed or game!
3/19/2013 12:34:26	Twitter Web Client	.@mcuban is so short off the tee he can't have much of a punch. He's just a weak man with a big mouth!
3/19/2013 11:32:13	Twitter for Android	WHO IS GOING TO GET IRAQ'S OIL???????
3/19/2013 11:30:44	Twitter for Android	Bombings all over Iraq today.That country is falling apart-such a horrible waste of lives and 1.5 trillion dollars (and I told you so!).
3/19/2013 11:15:21	Twitter for Android	@mcuban is very short off the tee - and his basketball sucks also!
3/19/2013 11:07:48	Twitter for Android	Golf match? I've won 18 Club Championships including this weekend. @mcuban swings like a little girl with no power or talent. Mark's a loser
3/18/2013 21:56:55	Twitter for Android	Apprentice ratings doing great - easily won the 10 o'clock hour over other networks!
3/18/2013 20:07:48	Twitter Web Client	The Blue Monster is being torn up at Trump @DoralResort. On April 1, I go out &amp; play it one more time until the new course opens.
3/18/2013 19:40:20	Twitter Web Client	.@DLoesch played great audio from my @CPACnews press conference on her radio show.  Glad she made it!
3/18/2013 19:35:13	Twitter Web Client	Scotland will be so lucky if this monstrosity is not built—I will tie them up in courts for years, if necessary.
3/18/2013 19:34:42	Twitter Web Client	Vattenfall CEO stated that the company needed to prepare itself for falling electricity demands in coming years-- a  changing market.
3/18/2013 19:33:27	Twitter Web Client	Vattenfall, the company behind a proposed asinine windfarm off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland, is having serious financial difficulty.
3/18/2013 18:56:21	Twitter Web Client	If @OMAROSA is not in the Board Room, I can’t fire her.  @latoyajackson made a strategic mistake.
3/18/2013 2:11:27	Twitter Web Client	I will not be commenting on boardroom specifics- would be unfair to the different time zones. #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 2:00:10	Twitter Web Client	True, @THEGaryBusey is a scene stealer without trying. He’s got a gift. #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:49:13	Twitter Web Client	.@DennisRodman re @Omarosa is right, she’s becoming predictable.
3/18/2013 1:44:54	Twitter Web Client	.@Omarosa is not winning points, being called “the wicked witch of the Mid-West” and most certainly other things. #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:39:16	Twitter Web Client	.@Omarosa’s new name via @DennisRodman: “Ms. Saboteur” sounds rather elegant. #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:36:00	Twitter Web Client	.@Omarosa’s emergency has put a new spin on Team Power’s presentation—but it’s not “show time” yet. #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:33:04	Twitter Web Client	.@latoyajackson informs @ArsenioHall  that @Omarosa is a “conniving witch”—is he surprised? Are we surprised? #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:20:57	Twitter Web Client	There’s no love lost between @latoyajackson  &amp; @OMAROSA Disrespectful? Who is being disrespectful? #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:17:57	Twitter Web Client	Music cues, audience participation, sounds like a very active Team Power. #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:12:45	Twitter Web Client	.@Omarosa on the cover of Soap Opera Digest? That’s a credential… #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:09:17	Twitter Web Client	And happy to welcome @ArsenioHall back as an advisor— he will have his own show and is doing great. #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:07:41	Twitter Web Client	.@TraceAdkins is back—good news for Plan B. #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:06:55	Twitter Web Client	The Paley Center for Media is a great place to visit when you’re in NYC. #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:06:30	Twitter Web Client	.@Omarosa has another meltdown … while giving a check for $40,000 to Michael’s charity, the Sue Duncan Center. #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:03:38	Twitter Web Client	Great line from @TheGaryBusey:  “I am an angel in an earth suit.” Do you agree? #CelebApprentice
3/18/2013 1:01:37	Twitter Web Client	.@Omarosa’s meltdown—was it for real? @DennisRodman thinks she could be an Oscar winner for that performance… #CelebApprentice
3/17/2013 18:40:35	Twitter for Android	The tournament at Trump National Doral was much more exciting than what is going on now!

3/15/2013 23:33:34	Twitter for Android	Thanks for all of the accolades on my speech today - it's all about the truth!
3/15/2013 23:27:08	Twitter Web Client	Honest reporters stated that the Prayer Breakfast was going on during my CPAC speech and security was very slow to let people in-long lines!
3/15/2013 23:13:22	Twitter for Android	I agreed to take the worst spot at CPAC because nobody else wanted it and it was the only time I could be there - it was great fun!
3/15/2013 23:03:16	Twitter for Android	WHY CAN'T THE MEDIA TELL THE TRUTH - WE WOULD ALL BE SO MUCH BETTER OFF!
3/15/2013 20:41:23	Twitter Web Client	For accurate reporting of my @CPACnews speech, read @PoliticalTicker, @Newsmax_Media, @politico, @HuffPostPol....

3/15/2013 20:32:34	Twitter Web Client	@jheil at @NYMag is such a pathetic reporter who doesn’t want to know the truth. A total Obama flunky &amp; hack.
3/15/2013 20:27:16	Twitter Web Client	Boring &amp; failing @NYMag’s 3rd rate political reporter @jheil had flunky @DanAmira write a totally false report about me today......
3/15/2013 20:27:04	Twitter Web Client	..... He knows I don’t respect him.
3/15/2013 18:13:32	Twitter Web Client	I watched the last two minutes of the @dallasmavs game last night--- I just loved watching them lose.
3/15/2013 18:10:48	Twitter Web Client	Press conference after CPAC speech this morning was excellent- lots of very professional reporters.
3/15/2013 18:10:12	Twitter Web Client	The CPAC speech went really well this morning--- first speaker--- standing ovation. I really enjoyed it.
3/14/2013 20:57:10	Twitter Web Client	When you think big, you will automatically trigger more details because details are the major component of making anything big.

3/14/2013 20:43:34	Twitter Web Client	.@mcuban has less TV persona than  any other person I can think of. He’s an arrogant, crude, dope who met some very stupid people...
3/14/2013 20:43:30	Twitter Web Client	...Those stupid people bought @mcuban's company (of which he owned a piece).
3/14/2013 20:28:50	Twitter Web Client	There’s a reason @mcuban’s partners can’t stand him and on top of that, the team sucks!
3/14/2013 19:34:37	Twitter Web Client	CPAC attendees &amp; fellow patriots - lines for my @CPACnews start at 7:00AM outside the Potomac Ballroom. Make sure to get there early!

3/14/2013 18:57:35	Twitter Web Client	When @mcuban had his own show, The Benefactor, it totally “bombed!”
3/14/2013 18:57:31	Twitter Web Client	I love watching dummy @mcuban promote on ok show named Shark Tank—but he is just a small part of that show.
3/14/2013 18:45:59	Twitter Web Client	Good move by @MSNBC in downgrading @WeGotEd to a dead weekend spot. This is truly a guy who shouldn't be on tv.
3/14/2013 18:18:47	Twitter Web Client	. @BarbaraJWalters made a great decision in firing @JoyVBehar from @theviewtv. The show will be better without her!

3/14/2013 17:06:58	Twitter Web Client	To show you how shallow politicians can be, many are jealous of my @CPACnews speaking slot &amp; also their fellow Republicans! Not good!
3/14/2013 16:56:38	Twitter Web Client	The DC press corps is obsessed with my @CPACnews speech which is scheduled  tomorrow 8:45AM in the Potomac Ballroom. Can't blame them.
3/14/2013 16:47:17	Twitter Web Client	Wow--just 1 day after my offer to fund all WH tours "Obama backtracks on decision to cancel all White House tours” ...
3/14/2013 16:23:05	Twitter Web Client	Dummy @mcuban made up a story about a visit to Mar-a-Lago last night on Leno. It never happened—I don’t talk that way.

3/13/2013 20:02:57	Twitter Web Client	Do your homework. Wasting other people’s time due to poor planning and thoughtlessness will only leave a bad impression.
3/13/2013 20:01:31	Twitter Web Client	According to new WPOST-ABC poll, Obama has just lost 14 points on public trust with economy
3/13/2013 18:53:05	Twitter Web Client	In making any decision, you need all the facts. But after exhausting all due diligence, in the end you have to go with your gut!

3/13/2013 16:57:24	Twitter Web Client	.@CPACnews had its largest ever ticket sales the day of my announcement. Really an honor. Can’t wait to see everyone.
3/13/2013 16:52:20	Twitter Web Client	The sequester is less than 2% of total 2013 budget. Why can’t the WH re-allocate funds and keep the tours open for children? #OpenOurWH
3/13/2013 16:45:53	Twitter Web Client	Lines for my @CPACnews address start at 7:00AM outside the Potomac Ballroom. ACU has asked that you get there early. #CPAC2013
3/13/2013 15:44:35	Twitter Web Client	It’s sad that the WH is punishing children from across the country by closing all tours. Doesn’t have to be.  WH should take my offer.

3/11/2013 2:33:11	Mobile Web (M5)	Re my hair-Should I change it? What do you think?

2/26/2013 1:02:07	Twitter for Android	Shark Tank is a dead Friday night filler compared to the Apprentice which has been number one show for week in the T. V. ratings!
2/25/2013 20:58:06	Twitter Web Client	Our leaders are terrible. The government spends over $50B a day.  It can’t find cuts for less than 2 days of spending?! Sad!

2/25/2013 14:11:00	Twitter Web Client	Last night William Shatner had more airtime than any winner. It should have been called the William Shatner show...

2/24/2013 13:12:04	Twitter for Android	Why didn't movie Lincoln use Ford's Theater for big scene instead of the stage of an unrelated theater?
2/24/2013 12:50:07	Twitter for Android	Big response to my Tea Party statement-remember they were never fully energized by Romney campaign and will have far more power with time.

2/12/2013 19:27:07	Twitter Web Client	How can any Senator vote for Hagel as Sec. of Defense after that horrific hearing? He is not up for the job but will probably get it.

2/12/2013 15:31:16	Twitter Web Client	Can you imagine if @billmaher said about Obama what he said about me (orangutan etc)—the press would run him out of the country...
2/12/2013 15:31:10	Twitter Web Client	... but @billmaher is allowed to say that about me.

2/11/2013 20:43:56	Facebook	.@KarlRove is far more to blame for Obama's victory than the Tea Party.
2/11/2013 17:50:50	Twitter Web Client	I don’t like bullies.  I am not going to stand around and watch @KarlRove target the Tea Party.  Karl Rove gave us Barack Obama. Loser.

2/9/2013 23:20:31	Twitter Web Client	.@BillMaher's so called show on HBO must be the cheapest "special" produced in the history of television--- it sucks!

2/8/2013 13:02:15	Mobile Web (M5)	@karlrove Ashley Judd ad makes her and Obama look great...nobody wastes money like Karl Rove!
2/8/2013 13:00:23	Mobile Web (M5)	Is @karlrove incompetent? 400 million dollars down the drain and not 1 victory!
2/7/2013 21:50:04	Twitter Web Client	The dollar always talks in the end--although our pols are killing the dollar!
2/7/2013 21:42:41	Twitter Web Client	Can you imagine if Bush’s administration drafted a memo legalizing the killing of Americans?! Democrats are such hypocrites.

2/7/2013 17:50:13	Twitter Web Client	Karl Rove’s strategy and commercials were the worst I have ever seen.
2/7/2013 17:49:30	Twitter Web Client	Karl Rove is a total loser. Money given to him might as well be thrown down the drain.
2/7/2013 17:49:04	Twitter Web Client	Why are people giving money to Karl Rove when he just wasted $400M without any victories? Use your head.
2/7/2013 17:38:14	Twitter Web Client	@erikcantu Even better, government kills by drones but we can't even own guns.  Thanks Erik.

2/6/2013 14:48:57	Twitter Web Client	Re: immigration. Do the Republicans not realize that Dems will get 100% of 11 million votes no matter what they do?
2/6/2013 14:48:31	Twitter Web Client	Again, immigration reform is fine—but don’t rush to give away our country. That’s what’s happening!
2/6/2013 14:45:13	Twitter Web Client	Had a great time on the @HowardStern show this morning—he will and should never change!

2/5/2013 17:33:59	Twitter Web Client	Then ask: What am I pretending not to see? These two simple questions can pave the way for some very clear answers.

1/22/2013 20:00:05	Twitter Web Client	@AnthonyNoTweet  Make sure you are doing what you love to do. You need passion to keep you going.

1/22/2013 17:17:47	Twitter Web Client	@jeffjarvis  You were a terrible editor who got fired?--and you were wrong.
1/22/2013 16:27:07	Twitter Web Client	@mscijihenderson Midas Touch is a good choice for those with entrepreneurial interests.
1/22/2013 16:01:25	Twitter Web Client	You must promise that you will never cheat off Manti Te’o’s test papers.
1/22/2013 15:01:57	Twitter Web Client	@MooreReva Thanks Myriam--starts on Sunday March 3rd @NBC at 9 pm EST
1/22/2013 14:50:42	Twitter Web Client	Part of Obama’s new-found confidence is that the Republicans aren’t using their power of ideas properly or effectively.
1/22/2013 14:49:36	Twitter Web Client	Obama’s speech indicates he wants to change this country as we know it--wow, he really feels emboldened.
1/22/2013 14:45:51	Twitter Web Client	If the Republicans need a chief negotiator I am always available--or can recommend some really good ones!
1/22/2013 14:44:32	Twitter Web Client	Republicans, don’t extend the debt ceiling—make the great deal now!
1/22/2013 14:43:55	Twitter Web Client	The President’s speech was very combative toward Republicans—they have obviously not earned his respect!
1/21/2013 20:46:28	Twitter Web Client	Socialists think profits are a vice; I consider losses the real vice. - Winston Churchill
1/21/2013 20:26:26	Twitter Web Client	Glad to hear @InsideEdition has hired @_KatherineWebb to cover @SuperBowl.  She will be absolutely terrific! Miss USA pageant is proud.
1/21/2013 19:52:12	Twitter Web Client	Get ready for the fireworks between @OMAROSA &amp; @latoyajackson in 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice!  Neither one will back down.
1/21/2013 19:10:07	Twitter Web Client	Obama’s second term is going to very tough for the Republicans.  The Republicans must pick their battles wisely and play smart.
1/21/2013 18:40:01	Twitter Web Client	...Whether you are a Republican or Democrat we should hope that Pres. @BarackObama  does a great job for the country.
1/21/2013 18:39:43	Twitter Web Client	I wish President @BarackObama the best of luck in his second term...
1/21/2013 13:39:18	Mobile Web (M5)	Wow...NYT reports @celebrityapprentice was the number 1 show in branding on television for all of 2012.
1/21/2013 13:36:05	Mobile Web (M5)	Republicans and Democrats must come together now to make America great again!
1/18/2013 20:48:42	Twitter Web Client	Most people think small, because most people are afraid of success, afraid of making decisions, afraid of winning.    The Art of the Deal
1/17/2013 17:45:03	Twitter Web Client	All time hit leader Pete Rose should now be in the Baseball Hall Of Fame. He has paid his penalty!
1/17/2013 17:44:35	Twitter Web Client	.@Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing- great company!
1/17/2013 16:46:38	Twitter Web Client	The interview with Oprah will cause Lance Armstrong huge legal and financial problems- sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide.
1/17/2013 16:45:18	Twitter Web Client	I'll bet Lance Armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with Oprah-- he's saying to himself "what was I thinking?"
1/17/2013 16:36:15	Twitter Web Client	.@HBO should fire @BillMaher and bring back @DennisDMZ- someone that is actually funny.
1/17/2013 16:35:10	Twitter Web Client	.@BillMaher’s show is great for helping me get to sleep--- better than Sominex.
1/17/2013 16:30:15	Twitter Web Client	.@BillMaher needs to cut back on the pot, and maybe he will stop making offers he can’t afford.
1/17/2013 16:29:24	Twitter Web Client	Dumbass @BillMaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity--- we just presented him with a demand notice.
1/17/2013 16:12:40	Twitter Web Client	Brent Musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking- he is much more popular now than before.
1/17/2013 16:11:49	Twitter Web Client	.@ESPN’s apology(Brent Musburger) was a disgrace to broadcasting--- stop being so politically correct!
1/17/2013 16:09:18	Twitter Web Client	IMO--- Manti Te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy.
1/17/2013 16:06:30	Twitter Web Client	Can it just be new age that Manti Te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax?
1/17/2013 16:05:27	Twitter Web Client	Not believable that Manti Te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died. He is either very stupid....
1/17/2013 16:05:14	Twitter Web Client	...or mentally troubled (or a con).
1/17/2013 16:01:38	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to Tom Scocca and Timothy Burke of @Deadspin for exposing the Manti Te’o fiasco.
1/16/2013 17:08:23	Twitter Web Client	Look, I have always liked Lance Armstrong- I just hated what he did to himself, including recently. His life will now be hell.
1/16/2013 17:06:03	Twitter Web Client	Lance Armstrong made a really big mistake by opening up to Oprah. I’ll bet he wishes he had the chance to do it over again.
1/16/2013 17:02:04	Twitter Web Client	Lance Armstrong was given very, very bad advice!
1/16/2013 15:50:29	Twitter Web Client	Journal News readership is already down 50 percent over the years.
1/16/2013 15:49:19	Twitter Web Client	If everybody sued the Journal News for revealing their info (guns)- paper would go out of business.
1/16/2013 0:17:03	Mobile Web (M5)	@billmaher has not responded...not a word. His lawyers must have told him to shut up!
1/15/2013 21:32:08	Twitter Web Client	China watched Obama’s press conference yesterday salivating.  We will be borrowing trillions more from them.
1/15/2013 21:02:56	Twitter Web Client	Glad to hear Derek Jeter just removed his boot and is practicing on the field for @yankees.  Derek is a true champion.
1/15/2013 20:47:32	Twitter Web Client	Our country, under President Obama, is on life support! Great leaders must bring people together.
1/15/2013 20:30:56	Twitter Web Client	Re Lance Armstrong—not only was it a big lie but a big lie that lasted too long!
1/15/2013 20:21:51	Twitter Web Client	Does anyone really believe that Chuck Hagel is sorry for any of his past comments or supports Israel?
1/14/2013 20:40:10	Twitter Web Client	Still waiting for a response from @billmaher.  Does he even have $5 million?
1/14/2013 20:38:35	Twitter Web Client	Sadly, I’m probably helping @billmaher’s lowly rated show—but charity will benefit by $5 million so it’s worth it.
1/14/2013 20:13:50	Twitter Web Client	.@nbc did a great job last night with the @GoldenGlobes!
1/14/2013 20:12:15	Twitter Web Client	Back by popular demand, @latoyajackson returns to the 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice. She is fierce in the Board Room!
1/14/2013 19:57:41	Twitter Web Client	Just as I predicted, today Obama called for even more tax increases.  The Republicans played right into his hands and blew their cards.
1/14/2013 19:55:11	Twitter Web Client	Can you imagine if Obama had to give today's press conference before the election? He would have lost.  @GOP really blew it.
1/14/2013 19:36:43	Twitter Web Client	According to many, and while nominated, I would have won the Emmy many times except for my politics. @PrimetimeEmmys
1/14/2013 19:32:00	Twitter Web Client	Lance Armstrong is now going to admit guilt—can that be possible after many years of denying? Just go away Lance.
1/14/2013 18:54:49	Twitter Web Client	Is @billmaher the dumbest man on television?—I think so.
1/14/2013 18:54:07	Twitter Web Client	By the way, folks, @billmaher is not a smart guy (just look at his past)—he just pretends he is!
1/14/2013 18:53:30	Twitter Web Client	Dopey @billmaher is in for a lot of trouble—I hope he has $5 million (for charity).
1/14/2013 18:41:45	Twitter Web Client	I am a handwriting analyst. Jack Lew’s handwriting shows, while strange, that he is very secretive—not necessarily a bad thing.
1/14/2013 18:03:12	Twitter Web Client	The Republicans have been played into a trap by the President--they forgot the 14th amendment.....
1/14/2013 18:03:07	Twitter Web Client	...and will be very embarrassed unless they get smart fast.
1/14/2013 16:56:05	Twitter Web Client	I can’t believe @Denver_Broncos allowed final touchdown—dumbest defensive play I have ever seen in football.
1/14/2013 16:55:18	Twitter Web Client	Peyton Manning should have passed on 3rd down!
1/14/2013 15:51:52	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to Bob Kraft and Coach Bill Belichick for having built an amazing team. @Patriots
1/14/2013 15:43:46	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to Tom Brady @Patriots -- he is a great quarterback and a great champion!
1/14/2013 15:38:14	Twitter Web Client	Wow, I have just exceeded 2 million followers--and in such a short time!
1/11/2013 20:25:06	Twitter Web Client	I can’t wait to donate @billmaher’s $5 million to charity.  Just waiting on @billmaher to send me the money.
1/11/2013 18:55:36	Twitter Web Client	Let’s get out of Afghanistan. Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense!  Rebuild the USA.
1/11/2013 18:24:47	Twitter Web Client	The Republicans are always worried about the press--they should just do what is right.
1/11/2013 17:24:33	Twitter Web Client	The Baldwin family is well represented in the 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice with @StephenBaldwin.  Stephen does great.

1/9/2013 20:24:16	Twitter Web Client	It’s amazing that people can say such bad things about me but if I say bad things about them, it becomes a national incident.
1/9/2013 20:23:49	Twitter Web Client	Apparently @MartinBashir said something about me on his show yesterday.  I was surprised to find out he is on TV.  Who knew?!
1/9/2013 18:05:13	Twitter Web Client	I hope @billmaher pays quickly so that this money can immediately be given to the charities.
1/9/2013 18:03:03	Twitter Web Client	The charities I have designated for @billmaher's donations are: Police Athletic League-New York, March of Dimes, Hurricane Sandy victims....
1/9/2013 18:02:55	Twitter Web Client	...American Cancer Society, and the Dana Farber Cancer Center.
1/9/2013 17:59:03	Twitter Web Client	I have accepted @billmaher’s $5 million offer paid to me for charity (made on the @jayleno show).
1/9/2013 17:58:58	Twitter Web Client	Lawyers have sent @billmaher demand notice and necessary documentation.
1/9/2013 16:15:40	Twitter Web Client	.@billmaher was so nervous talking about me on the @jayleno show—I’ve never seen him like that!
1/9/2013 14:55:46	Twitter Web Client	@Adam4integrity  True. @gretawire is great at what she does.

1/8/2013 18:57:48	Twitter Web Client	Miss Alabama, Katherine Webb, has been a truly great representative of the Ms. USA Organization ..We are proud of her!
1/8/2013 17:33:39	Twitter Web Client	Why would Obama ever nominate someone for Sec. of Defense who opposes sanctions against Iran when Obama claims to support them?
1/8/2013 17:25:08	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @AlabamaFTBL on winning the BCS championship last night!
1/7/2013 20:19:29	Twitter Web Client	Glad to hear my @foxandfriends’ Monday interview continues to get big ratings.  Great way to start your week
1/7/2013 19:29:38	Twitter Web Client	Nominating Chuck Hagel for SOD is the wrong move for Obama.  He doesn’t need the fight.  Too much political capital will be wasted.
1/7/2013 19:28:04	Twitter Web Client	I hope the Republicans are happy.  Just as I predicted, that stupid deal they voted for only whetted Obama’s appetite for more taxes.

1/3/2013 20:37:26	Twitter Web Client	Great to see Sec. Clinton leaving the hospital yesterday with @ChelseaClinton and Pres. Clinton.  Glad she is recuperating.
1/3/2013 20:23:41	Twitter Web Client	So Obama and Congress can waste billions in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan building roads &amp; schools but can’t get money to the NJ &amp; NY Sandy victims?
1/3/2013 20:20:48	Twitter Web Client	The Republicans look so weak and foolish—what the hell are they doing?
1/3/2013 17:25:38	Twitter Web Client	The boardroom has never been as intense as in the upcoming13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice. Premieres March 3rd on @NBC!
1/3/2013 16:21:49	Twitter Web Client	I can't believe Republican leadership allowed such a stupid deal to be made. They are rapidly giving up all of their cards.

1/2/2013 21:53:35	Twitter Web Client	.@RGIII &amp; @DangeRussWilson &amp; Luck are very special players--will be great playoff games.
1/2/2013 19:27:07	Twitter Web Client	This ‘deal’ @RNC voted for has $41 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts.  It is pathetic.  Obama is laughing at them.
1/2/2013 19:23:37	Twitter Web Client	Make sure you realize that this ‘deal’ is only a stop gap measure.Obama will be looking to raise even more taxes in the coming negotiation..
1/2/2013 19:23:18	Twitter Web Client	...Remember--I told you so.
1/2/2013 19:18:18	Twitter Web Client	Obama's deal raises taxes on 77% of national households.  With Obama Care taxes kicking in now, everyone will be paying for his 2nd term.
1/2/2013 18:36:06	Twitter Web Client	.@GOP’s election loss and failed negotiations will serve as a case study in how third parties come about.
1/2/2013 18:27:12	Twitter Web Client	The Republicans must face reality &amp; create a strong &amp; positive immigration policy--if not they will continue to lose elections.
1/2/2013 17:45:03	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @RobinRoberts on celebrating 100 days in her bone marrow transplant recovery.  Robin is a special person.
1/2/2013 14:57:44	Twitter Web Client	Does any Republican have the ability to negotiate?

1/1/2013 15:20:23	Mobile Web (M5)	Maybe Boehner will stop this one sided deal in the House...I hope so!
1/1/2013 15:16:41	Mobile Web (M5)	What is Mitch McConnell thinking?...make the big deal!
1/1/2013 15:13:14	Mobile Web (M5)	I am a Republican...but the Republicans may be the worst negotiators in history!
1/1/2013 15:10:46	Mobile Web (M5)	Obama and the Democrats are laughing at the deal they just made...the Republicans got nothing!

12/28/2012 21:22:28	Twitter Web Client	@Earther57  Sounds nice--and thanks. Happy New Year to you and yours.
12/28/2012 20:45:15	Twitter Web Client	Raising the capital gains tax in this fragile economic time is the dumbest thing Washington could do.  So they will probably do it.

12/28/2012 20:09:48	Twitter Web Client	Once again Obama is going to lose on another prospective nomination. Chuck Hagel will not be named Sec. of Defense--&amp; probably shouldn't be.
12/28/2012 19:50:52	Twitter Web Client	Obama wants taxes to go up so he can take credit for lowering them next year.
12/28/2012 19:24:59	Twitter Web Client	Any deal completed before the fiscal curb must have tangible cuts on expenditures, in baseline spending, so we can get our credit back.
12/28/2012 19:01:28	Twitter Web Client	The Republicans once again hold all the cards with the debt ceiling.  They can get everything they want.  Focus!

12/27/2012 22:10:33	Twitter Web Client	Republicans remember—debt ceiling, debt ceiling, debt ceiling—be smart and you will win!
12/27/2012 21:22:20	Twitter Web Client	It’s Thursday.  How much time did Washington waste today trying to find a solution on the so-called fiscal cliff?
12/27/2012 20:06:58	Twitter Web Client	I told the Republicans the debt ceiling talks should come before election--&amp; we would have a Republican president—they wouldn’t listen.
12/27/2012 19:54:01	Twitter Web Client	I hate hearing after all of the hard work that @MittRomney never wanted to become President.

12/21/2012 20:13:36	Twitter Web Client	.@NBC really happy with how well the #MissUniverse pageant went.

11/10/2012 17:05:05	Twitter Web Client	Aberdeen tourism is booming because of my great Scottish golf club. 
11/10/2012 15:34:08	Twitter Web Client	Many political pundits are using the term "Art of the Deal".... they should thank me. That is my term and book title.
11/10/2012 15:32:48	Twitter Web Client	Never ever quit, never give up - Donald J. Trump, The Art of the Deal.
11/10/2012 15:23:55	Twitter Web Client	Thanks- many are saying I'm the best 140 character writer in the world. It's easy when it's fun.
11/10/2012 15:23:10	Twitter Web Client	I love Twitter.... it's like owning your own newspaper--- without the losses.
11/10/2012 15:19:23	Twitter Web Client	I'm a skeptical guy, but I don't believe Petraeus used this to get out of the Benghazi hearings.
11/10/2012 14:56:25	Twitter Web Client	Wow,  I never saw the Petraeus thing coming. A straight laced guy! Very sad for him and his family.
11/10/2012 14:53:26	Twitter Web Client	I just passed a 10 block long gas line going to LGA airport, a terrible situation!
11/9/2012 21:02:50	Twitter Web Client	Everybody wants me to talk about Robert Pattinson and not Brian Williams—I guess people just don’t care about Brian!
11/9/2012 21:02:02	Facebook	She’s baaack! @Rosie needs me to salvage her dying career. But it won’t help-- she’s got no talent &amp; no persona. Too many tv cancellations!
11/9/2012 20:07:49	Twitter Web Client	Price gouging at many gas stations, $10 a gallon--welcome to the new world.
11/9/2012 20:06:10	Twitter Web Client	It’s hard to believe that we are rationing gas in NYC. OPEC is laughing all the way to the bank.
11/9/2012 19:59:25	Twitter Web Client	.@cyndilauper Condolences on the passing of your uncle, and best wishes.
11/9/2012 19:46:26	Twitter Web Client	.@antbaxter Only the stupid @BBC would air your garbage—no wonder they are in such deep trouble.
11/9/2012 19:45:05	Twitter Web Client	.@antbaxter  Anthony—did you illegally take clips from the Letterman @Late_Show show and @GolfChannel without their approval?
11/9/2012 19:44:59	Twitter Web Client	.@antbaxter  I predict somebody is going to sue you!
11/9/2012 19:41:48	Twitter Web Client	.@antbaxter Dummy,thanks for increasing awareness of my big golf project in Aberdeen—sales are thru the roof &amp; Aberdeen seeing big benefits.
11/9/2012 19:40:31	Twitter Web Client	.@antbaxter—Heard your documentary cost you less than $3,000 to make—where did you get that kind of money?
11/9/2012 19:39:38	Twitter Web Client	.@antbaxter—Your documentary works better than any sleeping pill—in fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage!
11/9/2012 19:30:11	Twitter Web Client	Why do so many people say I hate President Obama—I don’t hate the President at all. I just disagree with his policies!
11/9/2012 19:07:44	Twitter Web Client	9 million fewer people voted for Obama this election than last &amp; yet the Republicans lost—do you think they might be doing something wrong!
11/9/2012 18:57:05	Twitter Web Client	I got to know @johnboehner very well—he is a great guy who will do the right thing for the country!
11/9/2012 18:49:55	Twitter Web Client	I received such a nice letter today from someone who took refuge in Trump Tower during Sandy. It was my pleasure to help.
11/9/2012 18:36:02	Twitter Web Client	Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight. He took my advice on Kristen Stewart...I hope!
11/9/2012 18:31:42	Twitter Web Client	The election was a major setback for economy. All young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate Obama's policies into their investments.
11/9/2012 15:23:42	Twitter Web Client	Of the 9 battleground states, we only carried North Carolina. I'm proud of @NCGOP &amp; glad I delivered keynote at their state convention.
11/9/2012 14:55:33	Twitter Web Client	Remember to watch the series finale of "The Men Who Built America" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History
11/8/2012 22:52:33	Twitter Web Client	Polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for Obama on his win- isn't that ridiculous?
11/8/2012 22:44:23	Twitter Web Client	Romney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one- they should have used me in Florida and Ohio &amp; he would be President.
11/8/2012 22:18:58	Twitter Web Client	Remember to watch the series finale of "The Men Who Built America" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History
11/8/2012 21:59:34	Twitter Web Client	China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection.  They have never had it so good.  Will own America soon.
11/8/2012 21:19:07	Twitter Web Client	At the end of the day, Obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes. This was a winnable race.  GOP needs to do better!
11/8/2012 20:50:40	Twitter Web Client	With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can.  Can get a great deal.
11/8/2012 20:42:42	Twitter Web Client	.@davidaxelrod I'm sending you a check to help find a cure. @IvankaTrump says hi.
11/8/2012 20:12:25	Twitter Web Client	No surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating Obama's win.  They love a weak America that they can rip off.
11/8/2012 19:40:39	Twitter Web Client	I will and I agree! RT @ZacharyQuinto@realdonaldtrump you can't possibly make any more money. so why don't you make a difference instead?!
11/8/2012 19:24:55	Twitter Web Client	I started to get very worried about Mitt's chances when I heard that A-Rod donated to his campaign. Everything A-Rod touches turns bad.
11/8/2012 19:11:08	Twitter Web Client	Russian leaders are publicly celebrating Obama's reelection.  They can't wait to see how flexible Obama will be now.
11/8/2012 19:07:38	Twitter Web Client	It is that time of the year.  The Trump Wollman Skating Rink is open to the public in Central Park.  The greatest ice rink in the country.
11/8/2012 16:38:21	Twitter Web Client	Letterman @Late_Show had Brian Williams @NBCNightlyNews as guest last night, I was on last Thursday
11/8/2012 16:38:15	Twitter Web Client	...I  trounced him in ratings &amp; Letterman beat @jayleno last Thursday. Brian—are you irrelevant?
11/8/2012 16:08:25	Twitter Web Client	Tweet me back if u think we should start a petition to fire @hardball_chris for his  comments on Sandy &amp; the death &amp; destruction it caused.
11/8/2012 15:51:31	Facebook	A test: tweet me the reason @billmaher was fired from @ABC (other than his bad ratings).
11/7/2012 21:25:24	Twitter Web Client	Now that the election is over, watch Chrysler ship @Jeep production to China--my prediction.
11/7/2012 21:15:29	Twitter Web Client	It has been a pleasure to make so many friends and meet so many great people on the trail this past cycle.  We will fight on!
11/7/2012 21:12:26	Twitter Web Client	Beijing had a bigger celebration than Chicago last night.  The Chinese are happier with the election than we are.
11/7/2012 21:05:25	Twitter Web Client	The stock market and US dollar are both plunging today.  Welcome to @BarackObama’s second term.
11/7/2012 20:56:54	Twitter Web Client	Congrats to @KarlRove on blowing $400 million this cycle. Every race @CrossroadsGPS ran ads in, the Republicans lost. What a waste of money.
11/7/2012 20:52:35	Twitter Web Client	Millions without electricity across NY &amp; NJ. The media has covered for Obama’s massive failure. Can you imagine if this was another Pres?
11/7/2012 20:32:14	Twitter Web Client	Pervert alert.  @RepWeiner is back on twitter. All girls under the age of 18, block him immediately.
11/7/2012 19:24:14	Twitter Web Client	It's freezing and snowing in New York--we need global warming!
11/7/2012 19:03:40	Twitter Web Client	We have to make America great again!
11/7/2012 18:06:47	Twitter Web Client	Our country is totally split right now but someday it will come together!
11/7/2012 17:27:16	Twitter Web Client	Another four years--not good for the country but we'll have to live with it!
11/7/2012 17:25:09	Twitter Web Client	This was the Republicans election to win but they just blew it--reasons why to follow.
11/7/2012 17:20:12	Twitter Web Client	Brian, if I'm "well past the last exit to relevance" how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night? @NBCNightlyNews
11/7/2012 17:17:55	Twitter Web Client	Brian Williams was never a smart guy but always passes himself off as such. People will learn the truth! @NBCNightlyNews
11/7/2012 17:16:19	Twitter Web Client	Brian, I hope @NBCNightlyNews isn't paying you too much--look at what's happening to nightly news.
11/7/2012 17:14:35	Twitter Web Client	Brian--Thanks dummy--I picked up 70,000 twitter followers yesterday alone. Cable News just passed you in the ratings. @NBCNightlyNews
11/7/2012 17:02:13	Twitter Web Client	The voting booth process was a total disaster—it could and should be much better and more efficient—tremendous room for error!
11/7/2012 16:50:44	Twitter Web Client	.@bwilliams--wouldn't you love to have my ratings?
11/7/2012 16:50:17	Twitter Web Client	The only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show Rock Center which is totally dying in the ratings—a disaster!
11/7/2012 16:47:05	Twitter Web Client	.@bwilliams knows that I think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night.
11/7/2012 16:14:28	Twitter Web Client	Trump volunteers were out early today to offload cases of food and supplies for hard-hit Rockaways residents #Sandy
11/7/2012 16:13:01	Twitter Web Client	I’ve sent a 10-wheeler filled with 358 master cases of food and supplies to my hometown of Queens today #TrumpCares
11/7/2012 16:12:29	Twitter Web Client	P.S. 42 in Queens is getting a truckload of food and much needed supplies for Rockaway residents #HurricaneSandyRelief
11/7/2012 4:54:22	Twitter Web Client	House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.
11/7/2012 4:47:20	Twitter Web Client	Hopefully the House of Representatives can hold our country together for four more years...stay strong and never give up!
11/7/2012 4:45:09	Twitter Web Client	The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
11/7/2012 4:43:19	Twitter Web Client	Our nation is a once great nation divided!
11/7/2012 4:39:32	Twitter Web Client	Our country is now in serious and unprecedented  trouble...like never before.
11/7/2012 4:33:02	Twitter Web Client	This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy!
11/7/2012 4:30:51	Twitter Web Client	Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us.
11/7/2012 4:29:33	Twitter Web Client	We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!
11/7/2012 4:18:10	Facebook	Well, back to the drawing board!
11/7/2012 0:02:05	Twitter Web Client	@dionnewarwick thanks for your nice statement on Access Hollywood. You are a great person and talent...I adore you!
11/6/2012 21:35:11	Twitter Web Client	Truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light. --George Washington
11/6/2012 21:31:35	Twitter Web Client	Whoever wins today, remember that tomorrow we still have a country struggling. Our work is not done until America is strong again.
11/6/2012 21:24:38	Twitter Web Client	.@MRbelzer is a stone cold loser with no talent--why did they ever put him on "Law and Order?"
11/6/2012 21:23:00	Twitter Web Client	I love show "Law and Order" but the @MRbelzer casting is the worst ever. No talent--unwatchable!
11/6/2012 21:21:17	Twitter Web Client	I have had the pleasure of getting to know @AnnDRomney &amp; @MittRomney this past year. They love America. Let's push them over the top today.
11/6/2012 21:16:55	Twitter Web Client	Do we still want a President who bows to the Saudis and lets OPEC rip us off? Make America strong, vote for @MittRomney.
11/6/2012 21:11:38	Twitter Web Client	The federal gov. has handled Sandy worse than Katrina. There is no excuse why people don't have electricity or fuel yet.
11/6/2012 20:58:16	Twitter Web Client	.@ABFalecbaldwin  Alec--it's not science, it's a con--read the e-mails.
11/6/2012 20:42:39	Twitter Web Client	The federal gov. has handled Sandy worse than Katrina.  There is no excuse why people don’t have electricity or fuel yet.
11/6/2012 20:39:13	Twitter Web Client	Obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the American public. He can't.
11/6/2012 20:26:28	Twitter Web Client	If you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from Obama supporters, make sure you report it immediately.
11/6/2012 20:01:15	Twitter Web Client	Yesterday Obama campaigned with JayZ &amp; Springsteen while Hurricane Sandy victims across NY &amp; NJ are still decimated by Sandy.  Wrong!
11/6/2012 19:57:14	Twitter Web Client	Make sure to verify the voting machine does not switch your vote. If you have any problems, notify the poll workers.
11/6/2012 19:56:28	Twitter Web Client	More reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama. Pay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen
11/6/2012 19:46:54	Twitter Web Client	Save Medicare.  Vote for @MittRomney.  He will repeal Obamacare on day one.
11/6/2012 19:26:50	Twitter Web Client	Make sure to vote today.  Vote for real change.  Change that will deliver jobs and a free &amp; strong America.  Vote for @MittRomney.
11/6/2012 19:17:09	Twitter Web Client	In the 1950’s our climate was far more unstable than it has been over the last 5 years.
11/6/2012 19:15:52	Twitter Web Client	The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.
11/6/2012 15:33:25	Twitter Web Client	Remember: Obama turned down $5M to charity which I said I would increase by 10X to $50M--just to show simple records. He's hiding lots!
11/6/2012 15:19:37	Twitter Web Client	If you voted for Obama in 2008 to prove you were not a racist then vote for Romney in 2012 to prove you are not stupid. Thanks Walter D!
11/6/2012 15:05:12	Twitter Web Client	The Apprentice was the #1 show on television last season on Sunday from 10 to 11 --- congratulations Donald!
11/6/2012 14:55:57	Twitter Web Client	Despite the upcoming election, the cover of paper-thin Time Magazine looks like an ad for the movie Lincoln--sad!
11/6/2012 14:54:18	Twitter Web Client	Before you vote, think: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more!
11/6/2012 14:48:15	Twitter Web Client	Why is Obama playing basketball today? That is why our country is in trouble!
11/6/2012 14:40:11	Facebook	I was invited to be with Mitt Romney tonight --- win, lose, or draw, I’ll be there!
11/6/2012 14:35:34	Twitter Web Client	Answer to your questions- I will be voting at 10:30 AM at Lighthouse International 110 East 60th Street, Manhattan

11/5/2012 21:46:20	Twitter Web Client	Benghazi is bigger than Watergate.  Don’t let Obama get away with allowing Americans to die.  Kick him out of office tomorrow.
11/5/2012 21:43:30	Twitter Web Client	The outer boroughs of Manhattan are still devasted by Sandy. How would the press cover this if a Republican was President.
11/5/2012 21:36:02	Twitter Web Client	China is worried. The polls are trending for @MittRomney. They won’t be able to steal from us anymore.
11/5/2012 21:33:26	Twitter Web Client	.@ABFAlecBaldwin  P.S. Your brother @StephenBaldwin7 is doing very well on @ApprenticeNBC--and he stated he "adores you."
11/5/2012 21:32:15	Twitter Web Client	.@ABFAlecBaldwin  They were rising in the 1950's then went back down--they will go up and down through eternity.
11/5/2012 21:23:16	Twitter Web Client	Voting for @GovGaryJohnson is voting for Obama--don't waste your vote!
11/5/2012 21:19:29	Twitter Web Client	Tomorrow’s election will have historic repercussions for our country.  Make America strong again.  Vote for @MittRomney.
11/5/2012 21:10:22	Twitter Web Client	.@mcuban Letterman @Late_Show had his best ratings with me--and you bombed. People don't care about Mark Cuban.
11/5/2012 21:08:58	Twitter Web Client	After 13 seasons, @ApprenticeNBC easily beat Shark Tank in ratings last year-- better demos as well.
11/5/2012 21:07:52	Twitter Web Client	.@mcuban, Shark Tank was shoved to Friday evening-- Friday is considered “dead television.” Besides, you are not the star (&amp; never will be).
11/5/2012 21:06:26	Twitter Web Client	Obama just stated "It's always good to ignore Donald Trump." I state he is right, especially when the truth is against him.
11/5/2012 20:46:15	Twitter Web Client	.@mcuban Baseball commissioner and owners were smart when they didn’t want you to buy a team--- but I don’t think you have the money anyway.
11/5/2012 20:24:39	Twitter Web Client	I believe in the America that never gives up, never stops striving, never ceases believing in itself. -- @MittRomney, 11.2.12
11/5/2012 20:20:53	Twitter Web Client	Via @WSJ: “A New Direction For America” by @MittRomney
11/5/2012 19:54:25	Twitter Web Client	Like Al Sharpton, @DonnyDeutsch apologized to me for calling me a racist on @todayshow--apology accepted!
11/5/2012 19:39:29	Twitter Web Client	Don't believe Chrysler (if Obama wins)--see how fast @Jeep production will be moved to China--and I'll be watching!
11/5/2012 19:35:32	Twitter Web Client	.@mcuban When Apprentice became the #1 show on tv you tried copying me with The Benefactor- a complete and total ratings disaster for @ABC.
11/5/2012 19:33:20	Twitter Web Client	Only 1 mill. dollars @mcuban? Offer me real money and I’d consider it. Your team and networks lose so much money I doubt you have much left!
11/5/2012 19:29:21	Twitter Web Client	Dummy @mcuban is at it again trying to use me to get publicity for himself!
11/5/2012 19:12:59	Twitter Web Client	In ’08, America voted for Hope &amp; Change.  Instead, we got incompetency.  Now it is time to put a real job creator in office. Vote 4 Mitt!
11/5/2012 16:50:18	Twitter Web Client	We can't destroy the competitiveness of our factories in order to prepare for nonexistent global warming. China is thrilled with us!
11/5/2012 15:55:30	Twitter Web Client	It’s extremely cold in NY &amp; NJ—not good for flood victims. Where is global warming?
11/5/2012 15:31:31	Twitter Web Client	.@CNN is looking at Jeff Zucker to lead them out of the forest--Jeff would be a great choice.
11/5/2012 15:24:42	Twitter Web Client	Remember, go vote--we need real change this time.

11/4/2012 1:05:08	Twitter Web Client	Gary Johnson is asking people "to waste" their vote on him. Make it count - vote for @MittRomney.
11/4/2012 0:18:54	Twitter Web Client	We don’t want to have a recount in any of the battleground states. Obama will steal it. Make sure all your friends and family vote.
11/4/2012 0:03:28	Twitter Web Client	Obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years. 4 more years??
11/3/2012 17:53:17	Twitter Web Client	Undecideds in OH,PA and WI will make the difference. All should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under Obama.
11/3/2012 17:29:21	Twitter Web Client	Pennsylvania is in play @MittRomney. All undecideds in Philly suburbs should ask themselves - who do you trust most on @Israel?
11/2/2012 23:21:48	Twitter Web Client	I think @TheRevAl should take this challenge. Axelrod was too scared. RT: @RonKaufmanIntrn: Kaufstache vs. Sharpstache.
11/2/2012 19:55:15	Twitter Web Client	Considering Obama hasn’t proposed anything concrete, if he wins he won’t have a mandate.  Another 4 years of legislative stalemate.
11/2/2012 19:45:29	Twitter Web Client	Castro, Chavez and Ahmadinejad are all anxiously awaiting our election results.  They are praying Obama wins.
11/2/2012 19:44:39	Twitter Web Client	Obama promised 5.2% unemployment by October 2012.  His promises are worthless!
11/2/2012 19:43:41	Twitter Web Client	Go as far as you can see; when you get there, you'll be able to see farther. -- J.P. Morgan
11/2/2012 19:25:55	Twitter Web Client	Make sure to catch @history’s season finale of “The Men Who Built America” on Sun, November 11th.  Great show.
11/2/2012 19:11:26	Twitter Web Client	Reality TV’s #1 Bad Girl @OMAROSA is back on the upcoming 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice.   She is great as always.
11/2/2012 19:02:21	Twitter Web Client	Could be the hurricane helps @MittRomney--people are rioting in the streets over gasoline
11/2/2012 18:56:04	Twitter Web Client	Obama has destroyed the middle class.  In ’09, median household income was $55,198.  Now it is $50,678.  Four more years?
11/2/2012 18:44:08	Twitter Web Client	I have an idea for A-Rod---buy a home at @TrumpGolfLA overlooking the Pacific--will bring you better luck.
11/2/2012 18:39:09	Twitter Web Client	A-Rod is now looking for an expensive home in Beverly Hills--why aren't the @Yankees terminating his contract for misrepresentation?
11/2/2012 18:32:32	Twitter Web Client	.@eagles should sit Michael Vick. He is a great athlete but less than average quarterback.
11/2/2012 18:23:51	Twitter Web Client	We don't need a Secretary of Business to understand business, we need a president who understands business and I do -- @MittRomney
11/2/2012 18:23:04	Twitter Web Client	Unemployment is now 7.9%.  Four years and $6.5T later, that is really bad!
11/2/2012 17:46:48	Facebook	How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction.
11/2/2012 17:19:44	Twitter Web Client	Interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding.
11/2/2012 17:15:32	Twitter Web Client	People are struggling to get gasoline for their cars--we are like a third world country.
11/2/2012 17:06:11	Twitter Web Client	I'm sending lots of bottled water out to Staten Island &amp; Long Island.
11/2/2012 16:20:16	Twitter Web Client	.@TheRevAl came to my Trump Tower office to apologize for calling me a racist--very nice, apology accepted!
11/2/2012 15:56:13	Twitter Web Client	.@BarbaraJWalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her--sadly, I won't be able to do it.
11/2/2012 15:50:10	Twitter Web Client	.@RalphGilles of Chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language--not very professional.
11/2/2012 15:46:19	Twitter Web Client	We should not allow @Chrysler to move @Jeep jobs to China after they said they wouldn't--stay tuned!
11/2/2012 15:45:15	Twitter Web Client	.@Chrysler disputes my statement--but watch Chrysler move @Jeep jobs to China after the election.
11/2/2012 15:35:09	Twitter Web Client	With long gas lines &amp; total disarray from storm, the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama.
11/2/2012 15:33:03	Twitter Web Client	It was announced this morning that unemployment rose--this can't be good for Obama.
11/2/2012 14:55:13	Twitter Web Client	Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral. It will be the best resort in the country—Miami is hot!
11/2/2012 14:46:04	Twitter Web Client	I will start reviewing various political reporters etc &amp; websites as to their professionalism &amp; fairness—many people asking for this.
11/2/2012 14:37:21	Twitter Web Client	How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?  And he continues to lie to the public!
11/2/2012 14:14:04	Facebook	What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
11/2/2012 14:13:19	Twitter Web Client	Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
11/2/2012 13:57:19	Twitter Web Client	Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say!
11/2/2012 13:56:04	Twitter Web Client	If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused.
11/1/2012 16:01:50	Facebook	I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public.
11/1/2012 16:00:16	Facebook	President Obama missed the deadline!
11/1/2012 15:12:27	Twitter Web Client	Obama is a terrible negotiator. He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will!
11/1/2012 15:08:50	Twitter Web Client	Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China?  He is ruining American industry.
11/1/2012 14:45:34	Twitter Web Client	To all @MittRomney supporters, make sure you have taken advantage of early voting now so you can GOTV on election day.
11/1/2012 14:24:54	Twitter Web Client	You know the world is crazy when New York gets hit by a hurricane-- and Florida doesn't.
11/1/2012 14:23:22	Twitter Web Client	Let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories &amp; manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming. China is so happy!
11/1/2012 14:13:39	Twitter Web Client	Do you believe @algore is blaming global warming for the hurricane?
11/1/2012 14:08:46	Twitter Web Client	From 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the East Coast.
11/1/2012 13:59:45	Twitter Web Client	It's 10 AM: Two hours to go for Obama to easily pick up millions for charity!
10/31/2012 21:13:02	Twitter Web Client	The successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way. -- Dale Carnegie
10/31/2012 20:57:59	Twitter Web Client	Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President--give me a break.
10/31/2012 20:53:06	Twitter Web Client	A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to.  The onus is on Obama to first release his records.
10/31/2012 20:46:11	Twitter Web Client	President Obama, if it is important to you, I will substantially increase the $5M offer!
10/31/2012 20:45:20	Twitter Web Client	President Obama, please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow. It is so easy and could do so much good!
10/31/2012 20:40:52	Facebook	Thanks for all the nice words on my keeping the Trump Tower atrium accessible to stranded victims of #Sandy. My honor.
10/31/2012 20:01:15	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @MittRomney on getting the @DMRegister, @NewYorkPost, @NewYorkObserver &amp; @NashuaTelegraph endorsements!
10/31/2012 19:59:57	Twitter Web Client	Spoiler--@dennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of @CelebApprentice...
10/31/2012 19:54:28	Twitter Web Client	How does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show--&amp; his ratings stink. You'd think @HBO could do a lot better.
10/31/2012 19:36:43	Twitter Web Client	A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama’s lack of transparency. I don't blame them.
10/31/2012 19:29:38	Twitter Web Client	There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice, once he releases all of his records.
10/31/2012 19:14:10	Twitter Web Client	.@Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film is a smart deal for both sides.  Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue.
10/31/2012 19:11:21	Twitter Web Client	In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi.
10/31/2012 19:06:38	Twitter Web Client	Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ. Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater.
10/31/2012 19:00:16	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article. If I were a journalist this would be the next Watergate, and I would be a star.
10/31/2012 17:17:50	Twitter Web Client	.@oreillyfactor called me a "master marketeer" last night--I am not. I am a great builder--I build great things &amp; people come.
10/31/2012 16:19:42	Twitter Web Client	Kevin Garnett's response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitor--nothing wrong--in fact it was terrific. A champion!
10/31/2012 16:16:51	Twitter Web Client	I was standing with @SHAQ when a young high school star, Kevin Garnett @Celtics, said to a crowd "Forget Shaq, I want to meet Donald Trump."
10/31/2012 14:32:57	Twitter Web Client	I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go.
10/31/2012 14:30:09	Twitter Web Client	The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won't be doing it. What is he hiding?
10/30/2012 19:41:26	Twitter Web Client	The polls &amp; momentum  are trending towards @MittRomney. Don't let the hurricane change your thinking!
10/30/2012 19:07:22	Twitter Web Client	Fans shouldn't worry.  We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm.
10/30/2012 18:58:06	Twitter Web Client	Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?
10/30/2012 18:57:30	Twitter Web Client	Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years?
10/30/2012 18:34:39	Twitter Web Client	Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?
10/30/2012 18:08:43	Twitter Web Client	Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5.  Taylor is terrific!
10/30/2012 17:51:39	Twitter Web Client	Let’s be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday.
10/30/2012 17:49:58	Twitter Web Client	How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?
10/30/2012 17:45:59	Twitter Web Client	Without focus, it's just impossible to be successful at anything. --Midas Touch
10/30/2012 17:44:25	Twitter Web Client	I never fall for scams.  I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘Ali G’ interview
10/30/2012 17:32:36	Twitter Web Client	Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes.
10/30/2012 17:19:00	Twitter Web Client	These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.
10/30/2012 17:16:13	Twitter Web Client	The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline.
10/30/2012 16:45:11	Twitter Web Client	The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place &amp; kept thousands of people warm &amp; safe during the storm--thanks, staff!
10/30/2012 15:48:54	Twitter Web Client	Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more!
10/30/2012 15:48:22	Twitter Web Client	Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.
10/30/2012 14:28:32	Twitter Web Client	I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.
10/30/2012 14:08:03	Twitter Web Client	Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.
10/30/2012 14:06:18	Twitter Web Client	Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it.
10/30/2012 14:05:10	Twitter Web Client	Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.
10/30/2012 13:39:39	Twitter Web Client	I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.
10/30/2012 13:06:17	Twitter Web Client	The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse.
10/29/2012 19:18:33	Twitter Web Client	All weights are on crane's wrong side ---  very precarious below, move out!
10/29/2012 19:17:48	Twitter Web Client	If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower, call office.
10/29/2012 18:22:25	Twitter Web Client	We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food.
10/29/2012 18:18:48	Twitter Web Client	So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news. Let's see what happens later.
10/29/2012 17:59:12	Twitter Web Client	Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama. Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible!
10/29/2012 17:03:54	Twitter Web Client	Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.
10/29/2012 16:34:09	Twitter Web Client	Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was "probably" born in the US--the word "probably" is a disaster for Obama.
10/29/2012 16:29:31	Twitter Web Client	I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.
10/28/2012 16:08:04	Twitter Web Client	I guess @BillMaher saw my ratings on the @Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno. Bill, you are no Letterman.
10/28/2012 15:59:09	Twitter Web Client	While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.
10/28/2012 15:57:25	Twitter Web Client	.@BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't. Is this a double standard?
10/28/2012 14:16:46	Facebook	Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.
10/28/2012 14:14:36	Twitter Web Client	A lot changed when David Letterman said " he was probably born in this country"--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama.
10/27/2012 19:43:57	Twitter Web Client	@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy. But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy. Fight on John!
10/27/2012 19:41:43	Twitter Web Client	@BernardMcGuirk. That's more than O'Reilly did ...and he is supposed to be my friend. You're terrific!
10/27/2012 19:40:23	Twitter Web Client	@Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O'Reilly...you're terrific!
10/27/2012 19:28:52	Twitter Web Client	Alert...The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi. He did nothing...he is no leader.
10/27/2012 11:09:42	Twitter Web Client	@DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star. But, he just doesn't have what it takes...and he never will.
10/27/2012 11:08:27	Twitter Web Client	I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request, I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement.
10/26/2012 21:27:26	Facebook	I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.
10/26/2012 21:12:26	Facebook	The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone.
10/26/2012 20:40:30	Twitter Web Client	I hear they are very unhappy w/ Arianna and @huffingtonpost at @AOL. I’ll bet she won’t be there for long!
10/26/2012 20:26:08	Twitter Web Client	If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say?
10/26/2012 20:23:34	Twitter Web Client	If my offer is refused, every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $5M to charity all because he is hiding something!
10/26/2012 20:21:41	Twitter Web Client	Barack Obama has everything to gain. Why would anyone ever deny $5M to charity?
10/26/2012 19:55:17	Twitter Web Client	I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.
10/26/2012 19:53:50	Twitter Web Client	My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.
10/26/2012 19:50:53	Twitter Web Client	Where's the transparency? Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright.
10/26/2012 19:36:46	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner--to a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun.
10/26/2012 19:15:55	Twitter Web Client	Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
10/26/2012 18:52:49	Twitter Web Client	By the way, where is @Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah.
10/26/2012 18:48:42	Twitter Web Client	...Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
10/26/2012 18:45:58	Twitter Web Client	Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?
10/26/2012 18:36:57	Twitter Web Client	Be careful of an Obama "bomb" to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do.
10/26/2012 18:35:34	Twitter Web Client	The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney. He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding. VOTE!
10/26/2012 17:04:35	Twitter Web Client	Wow! Letterman show @Late_Show won the ratings last night big time--and guess who was his guest? DJT
10/26/2012 15:30:59	Twitter Web Client	What a dumb mistake AOL made buying the @huffingtonpost. How much longer will Arianna last--I predict not much.
10/26/2012 15:21:33	Twitter Web Client	@MikeMpef Thanks, I hope you enjoyed it, had a great time.
10/26/2012 15:05:20	Twitter Web Client	Stupid Arianna @huffingtonpost hired the man who ruined the once-great NYTimes Business Section...
10/26/2012 15:05:11	Twitter Web Client	...a real loser named Tim O'Brien--and it's never recovered.
10/26/2012 15:01:18	Twitter Web Client	Dopey Arianna @huffingtonpost is really after me--boring story after boring story...but I hear she is in big trouble!
10/26/2012 14:59:39	Twitter Web Client	I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 100...
10/26/2012 14:59:26	Twitter Web Client	... I will soon start naming magazines that I think will fold--I predicted Newsweek.
10/26/2012 14:46:54	Twitter Web Client	@LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors--Obama should choose that as his $5M charity.
10/26/2012 14:39:13	Twitter Web Client	.@SabrinaSiddiqui  Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor!
10/26/2012 14:05:28	Twitter Web Client	Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience, I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain....
10/26/2012 14:05:22	Twitter Web Client	....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
10/26/2012 14:02:49	Twitter Web Client	Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins
10/26/2012 13:57:14	Twitter Web Client	Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
10/26/2012 13:55:39	Twitter Web Client	Letterman @Late_Show was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.
10/26/2012 12:51:44	Twitter Web Client	The dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants. --The America We Deserve
10/25/2012 21:06:19	Twitter Web Client	It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
10/25/2012 20:48:49	Twitter Web Client	Doing David Letterman @Late_Show tonight at 11:30. 1st nite of Sweeps.Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before. Enjoy
10/25/2012 20:24:59	Twitter Web Client	Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires...
10/25/2012 20:15:11	Twitter Web Client	For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go.
10/25/2012 18:44:21	Twitter Web Client	I hope Derek Jeter’s recovery is going well.  He is a very special player and a great guy.  New York loves him. @yankees
10/25/2012 18:07:33	Twitter Web Client	@politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting.
10/25/2012 17:58:07	Facebook	What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.
10/25/2012 17:56:24	Twitter Web Client	@michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost, hoped Obama would be great for U.S. --- he wasn't.
10/25/2012 17:52:46	Twitter Web Client	.@Mark_Sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @EvaLongoria.  He will always do great!
10/25/2012 17:01:58	Twitter Web Client	I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.  Everyone wins.  Take the deal.
10/25/2012 16:48:07	Twitter Web Client	.@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv--Why did you choose me as one of the 10 Most Fascinating People of the Year last season (and more than once?)
10/25/2012 16:46:27	Twitter Web Client	.@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv will apologize to me just like she did when I was right about @Rosie. Besides, I get great ratings on The View.
10/25/2012 16:44:26	Twitter Web Client	.@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv  Barbara, unfortunately you've missed the entire point of my announcement--you just don't get it!
10/25/2012 16:37:08	Twitter Web Client	Still waiting for an explanation about why @GiulianaRancic &amp; @BillRancic did not name their son Donald.  Unbelievable.
10/25/2012 16:29:51	Twitter Web Client	Miss Universe 2012 Pageant will be airing live on @nbc &amp; @Telemundo december 19th. Open invite stands for Robert Pattinson.
10/25/2012 16:27:07	Twitter Web Client	Excited to announce that @GiulianaRancic &amp; @BravoAndy will be hosting the 2012 Miss Universe Pageant. Great ratings for Miss Universe.
10/25/2012 16:17:32	Twitter Web Client	How does @michellemalkin get a conservative platform? She is a dummy--just look at her past.
10/25/2012 15:58:05	Twitter Web Client	I am happy to have started #ObamasFavoriteCharity. Really enjoying reading everyone's tweets.
10/24/2012 22:08:42	Twitter Web Client	Just stated by a total pro: "You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking."
10/24/2012 21:55:22	Twitter Web Client	Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney.  It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention.
10/24/2012 21:49:39	Twitter Web Client	In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public...
10/24/2012 21:49:10	Twitter Web Client	... By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity.
10/24/2012 21:44:12	Twitter Web Client	Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when $5M is going to charity.
10/24/2012 21:43:01	Twitter Web Client	I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people
10/24/2012 21:38:51	Twitter Web Client	I just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth. A puppet of Obama?
10/24/2012 21:32:04	Twitter Web Client	Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama.  As Sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity.  What does Obama have to lose?”
10/24/2012 21:30:51	Twitter Web Client	Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find &amp; put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive.
10/24/2012 21:26:38	Twitter Web Client	My offer to Obama is about transparency. In 2008, American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record.
10/24/2012 16:49:40	Facebook	The response has been fantastic--- actually overwhelming! Thank you!
10/24/2012 13:20:16	Twitter Web Client	All predictions re: my 12 o'clock release are totally incorrect.  Stay tuned!
10/24/2012 13:18:52	Twitter Web Client	Story will be released today at 12 noon EST on Twitter and Facebook.
10/23/2012 21:18:29	Twitter Web Client	Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack. -- Sun Tzu
10/23/2012 20:42:27	Twitter Web Client	If you like having the world collapse and being told America is leading from behind--vote Obama.
10/23/2012 20:40:19	Twitter Web Client	No wonder @BBC is in such big trouble &amp; boss was just fired--they are lost.
10/23/2012 20:39:26	Twitter Web Client	.@BBC should never have played that piece of garbage documentary--&amp; yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course.
10/23/2012 20:38:33	Twitter Web Client	...that it was hard not to end up rooting for Trump..."
10/23/2012 20:38:06	Twitter Web Client	Thank you to @DailyTelegraph reviewer @NeilMidgley who stated "'You've Been Trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters...
10/23/2012 19:52:59	Twitter Web Client	.@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night. I only wish Mitt was more aggressive!
10/23/2012 18:45:09	Twitter Web Client	Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert &amp; Kristen.I don't have time except to say "Robert, drop her, she cheated on you &amp; will again!"
10/23/2012 18:30:48	Twitter Web Client	Last night was the first time Obama said "we" instead of "I" in respect to Bin Laden's killing.
10/23/2012 18:18:11	Twitter Web Client	Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit!
10/23/2012 18:10:56	Twitter Web Client	My announcement is tomorrow!
10/23/2012 18:09:34	Twitter Web Client	Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!
10/23/2012 17:13:07	Twitter Web Client	China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
10/23/2012 16:50:41	Twitter Web Client	Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing, not the President.
10/23/2012 16:41:55	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night. Yet some polls have him winning the debate.
10/23/2012 16:02:57	Twitter Web Client	When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden, is there anyone with a brain that would not have said "Ok, go get him"?
10/23/2012 15:18:14	Twitter Web Client	Lance Armstrong fought for 7 years &amp; then just ran out of energy. Very sad story--although they caught him red handed.He definitely cheated!
10/23/2012 14:14:44	Twitter Web Client	Casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent, from a director's point of view. -- Steven Spielberg
10/23/2012 14:09:11	Twitter Web Client	No matter what happens in the election, @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. He has kept Obama in it, even with his terrible record.
10/23/2012 13:29:38	Twitter Web Client	I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. By stopping, he gave his enemies an opening.
10/23/2012 11:14:46	Twitter Web Client	The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.
10/23/2012 11:13:17	Twitter Web Client	Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.
10/23/2012 11:12:41	Twitter Web Client	I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30.
10/23/2012 1:12:16	Twitter Web Client	Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate
10/23/2012 1:09:57	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.
10/23/2012 1:00:06	Twitter Web Client	Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
10/23/2012 0:19:05	Twitter Web Client	Well this is it, the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live.
10/22/2012 21:21:02	Twitter Web Client	Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
10/22/2012 21:10:33	Twitter Web Client	I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
10/22/2012 21:07:19	Twitter Web Client	Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
10/22/2012 20:48:40	Twitter Web Client	Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert.
10/22/2012 20:47:03	Twitter Web Client	Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden.
10/22/2012 20:44:55	Twitter Web Client	This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility. Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal.
10/22/2012 20:19:40	Twitter Web Client	Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.
10/22/2012 19:50:18	Twitter Web Client	The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success!
10/22/2012 19:28:43	Twitter Web Client	.@Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan. He drove you insane but, of course, Piers is a lot smarter than you
10/22/2012 19:05:05	Twitter Web Client	My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling.
10/22/2012 17:05:35	Twitter Web Client	I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy.
10/22/2012 16:43:36	Twitter Web Client	Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!
10/22/2012 16:29:35	Twitter Web Client	.@Toure, when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage, stop by and say hello.
10/22/2012 16:19:32	Twitter Web Client	Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism. We lose nothing to try.
10/22/2012 16:10:49	Twitter Web Client	Lots of autism and vaccine response. Stop these massive doses immediately. Go back to single, spread out shots! What do we have to lose.
10/22/2012 15:13:48	Twitter Web Client	Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement--- probably on Wednesday. 
10/22/2012 14:49:26	Twitter Web Client	People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda). Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work. It makes you hungry.
10/22/2012 14:36:38	Twitter Web Client	Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community &amp; are very expensive &amp; unreliable.
10/22/2012 14:25:11	Twitter Web Client	I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight.
10/22/2012 14:21:55	Twitter Web Client	Derek, get well soon, the @Yankees need youl.
10/22/2012 14:14:44	Twitter Web Client	Gas prices are at crazy levels--fire Obama!
10/22/2012 14:01:42	Twitter Web Client	They succeed, because they think they can. -- Virgil
10/21/2012 22:35:51	Twitter Web Client	Don Butler and executives are doing a great job at @Cadillac--- the cars are fantastic.
10/21/2012 17:38:18	Twitter Web Client	The biggest problem with A-Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees--- he must go.
10/21/2012 14:45:56	Twitter Web Client	Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack. Respect the wounded and dead.
10/21/2012 0:25:47	Twitter Web Client	Good luck to Derek on his operation. I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion.
10/21/2012 0:24:41	Twitter Web Client	Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately. It will be lucky for him like in past.
10/21/2012 0:24:11	Twitter Web Client	Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower.
10/19/2012 20:32:13	Twitter Web Client	7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.Real unemployment is at least 15%
10/19/2012 20:30:45	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney's @RNC convention came in over $3M under budget.  Barack’s @DNC convention is over $10M in debt.  What a surprise!
10/19/2012 20:25:53	Twitter Web Client	Can't wait for @VanityFair to fold which, under Graydon Carter, will be sooner rather than later.
10/19/2012 20:25:00	Twitter Web Client	.@VanityFair's terrible piece on Mitt's faith is a new low, even for them.
10/19/2012 20:23:29	Twitter Web Client	Where were all the @VanityFair exposes on "When Rev. Wright disciples go to Washington?"  Sad!
10/19/2012 20:17:58	Twitter Web Client	Rev. @BillyGraham is a great man and so is his son, Franklin Graham.
10/19/2012 20:17:07	Twitter Web Client	Rev.@BillyGraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the Christian community on @MittRomney.
10/19/2012 19:50:00	Twitter Web Client	Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night!
10/19/2012 19:47:52	Twitter Web Client	A lot of the @Yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season. They are lucky they don't have to deal with George Steinbrenner.
10/19/2012 19:37:35	Twitter Web Client	I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did. You can't do any worse!
10/19/2012 19:34:57	Twitter Web Client	@rginn_1 Toledo is a great place--I've been there &amp; worked in Cincinnati for 2 years--I love Ohio.
10/19/2012 19:24:32	Twitter Web Client	Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a 1 point lead. Mitt will pull away next week.
10/19/2012 19:23:03	Twitter Web Client	Obama has called Libya attack "a bump in the road" and "not optimal." Just come clean already--tell Americans the truth!
10/19/2012 19:17:34	Twitter Web Client	Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apartment next year. Very soon A-Rod won't need a place in NYC.
10/19/2012 19:15:31	Twitter Web Client	Yes--I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday.
10/19/2012 18:07:24	Twitter Web Client	.@katyperry is no bargain but I don't like John Mayer--he dates and tells--be careful Katy (just watch!).
10/19/2012 17:05:31	Twitter Web Client	So many tweets &amp; stories on Stewart/Pattinson Look, it doesn't matter-- the relationship will never be the same. It is permanently broken.
10/19/2012 16:44:52	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to Bernie Marcus &amp; Herman Cain @JobCreatorsUSA on the #TruthTour2012--All employers need to check this out!
10/19/2012 16:40:20	Twitter Web Client	.@lancearmstrong really blew it--went down in flames--too bad!
10/19/2012 16:38:13	Twitter Web Client	Why would Ohio listen to Bruce Springsteen reading his lines? Be careful or I will go to Ohio and @MittRomney will win it!
10/19/2012 16:17:42	Twitter Web Client	Obama said "not optimal" to Ambassador &amp; embassy killings--bad word usage for a Harvard graduate.
10/19/2012 15:47:09	Twitter Web Client	Great decision by Donald Graham @Newsweek to sell. I'll now have to take my newsweek covers off the wall.
10/19/2012 15:46:15	Twitter Web Client	With Barry Diller &amp; Tina Brown in charge, did anyone doubt that @Newsweek would be a massive failure?
10/19/2012 15:31:01	Twitter Web Client	Something really bad happened to the @Yankees psyche--much like our President!
10/19/2012 15:30:03	Twitter Web Client	.@Yankees should get rid of A-Rod ASAP--I can't watch this guy anymore!
10/19/2012 14:46:27	Twitter Web Client	.@evaemery Thanks--you sound great!
10/19/2012 13:56:38	Twitter Web Client	I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week--stay tuned!
10/19/2012 13:43:43	Twitter Web Client	Can't believe we are less than three weeks away from the election. Time certainly flies!
10/19/2012 13:23:51	Twitter Web Client	A penny saved is a penny earned. -- Benjamin Franklin
10/18/2012 22:11:46	Twitter Web Client	The Yankees are absolutely terrible--- what happened to this team?
10/18/2012 21:06:18	Twitter Web Client	Hey @Rosie--how is your recovery going? I hope you are doing well so we can start fighting again soon!
10/18/2012 20:42:09	Twitter Web Client	@crazymom28 I have a friend that wants to meet your sister.
10/18/2012 20:25:31	Twitter Web Client	The last time I visited China I couldn't believe all the construction. You can go up with a project in a week--no red tape.
10/18/2012 19:54:07	Twitter Web Client	It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?
10/18/2012 19:25:39	Twitter Web Client	Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right, the economy has not been fixed under Obama.I always said Bill was an honest man.
10/18/2012 19:19:34	Twitter Web Client	When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money, will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?
10/18/2012 19:11:20	Twitter Web Client	Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. Their internals must be horrendous.
10/18/2012 18:02:58	Twitter Web Client	While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars, ours fans will be happy to see @Joan_Rivers in the board room.She is back!
10/18/2012 17:59:23	Twitter Web Client	Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment. Derek--only in a Trump building--Trump is lucky for you.
10/18/2012 16:41:47	Twitter Web Client	Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy.
10/18/2012 16:39:34	Twitter Web Client	I think the @yankees will win today. Unlike A-Rod, CC is good under pressure. I hope A-Rod plays, however.
10/18/2012 16:21:53	Twitter Web Client	Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.
10/18/2012 16:16:08	Twitter Web Client	@G_Harwood  Because they are either jealous or losers (or both).
10/18/2012 15:49:47	Twitter Web Client	Newsweek ending print edition--sad. Now my Newsweek covers mean nothing--they lost all credibility. TIME to follow?
10/18/2012 14:57:19	Twitter Web Client	@loveandgarbage  Dopey--who went bankrupt, you? I never did.
10/18/2012 14:49:56	Twitter Web Client	The biggest thrill in the world is entertaining the public, there is no bigger thrill than that. --Vince McMahon @WWE
10/18/2012 14:45:04	Twitter Web Client	@womenzbinder Check the records, dummy--I was never a Bush II fan--he is why we have Obama!
10/18/2012 14:27:57	Twitter Web Client	Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion. She will cheat again--100 certain--am I ever wrong?
10/18/2012 14:15:01	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to honoring the great Dogan family &amp; the success of the Trump Towers project in Istanbul @FollowTurkey Annual Gala Dinner
10/18/2012 13:07:30	Twitter Web Client	Alert--US jobless claims up 46,000 to 388,000. Really bad news. 7.8% is now a fraud--not possible!
10/18/2012 13:06:02	Twitter Web Client	Amazing--my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @WSJ.
10/18/2012 12:39:51	Twitter Web Client	When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $5 trillion of deficits over the last four years. --@MittRomney
10/18/2012 12:37:43	Twitter Web Client	Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future. Does he even care?
10/17/2012 20:50:46	Twitter Web Client	.@ashleycam2883 Re: Libya--Hillary took the blame for Obama.
10/17/2012 20:42:56	Twitter Web Client	Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth.
10/17/2012 20:09:53	Twitter Web Client	If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records--all of them.
10/17/2012 20:00:26	Twitter Web Client	.@mystikangel  Bring @johnrich back? He is back!
10/17/2012 19:06:32	Twitter Web Client	What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.
10/17/2012 18:54:24	Twitter Web Client	Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
10/17/2012 18:47:19	Twitter Web Client	Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog &amp; will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!
10/17/2012 18:40:15	Twitter Web Client	Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback.
10/17/2012 18:35:11	Twitter Web Client	Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned.
10/17/2012 18:32:55	Twitter Web Client	Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.
10/17/2012 18:30:13	Twitter Web Client	@BillRancic  Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald.
10/17/2012 18:14:10	Twitter Web Client	Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters, even A-Rod, they got you there.
10/17/2012 18:11:24	Twitter Web Client	While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished, they won't quit for CC
10/17/2012 16:54:28	Twitter Web Client	Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary
10/17/2012 16:42:52	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style.
10/17/2012 16:36:21	Twitter Web Client	...Bad decisions can be devastating.
10/17/2012 16:35:43	Twitter Web Client	Obama was beaten but not knocked out.  He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance...
10/17/2012 16:20:33	Twitter Web Client	All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board.  Mitt will remember the early helpers.
10/17/2012 15:53:05	Twitter Web Client	If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally &amp; aesthetically.
10/17/2012 15:51:55	Twitter Web Client	Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines &amp; how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster.
10/17/2012 15:39:31	Twitter Web Client	Remember, new "environment friendly"  lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.
10/17/2012 15:32:59	Twitter Web Client	Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances &amp; environment of many countries &amp; communities.
10/17/2012 15:26:05	Twitter Web Client	Really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay. I am a long time Yankee fan.
10/17/2012 15:07:53	Twitter Web Client	My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million--&amp; all the "biggies." It's like having your own newspaper.
10/17/2012 15:06:50	Twitter Web Client	My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
10/17/2012 14:30:21	Twitter Web Client	Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!
10/17/2012 14:17:40	Twitter Web Client	Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.
10/17/2012 14:16:25	Twitter Web Client	Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
10/17/2012 13:55:45	Twitter Web Client	Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!
10/17/2012 13:54:51	Twitter Web Client	I still love Derek, he is a winner!
10/17/2012 13:54:31	Twitter Web Client	Remember, I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it, he broke his foot.
10/17/2012 13:51:03	Twitter Web Client	At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying, why didn't he do it?  He lost me a long time ago.
10/17/2012 13:45:42	Twitter Web Client	Verlander pitched great, but @Yankees look truly defeated.
10/17/2012 12:26:39	Twitter Web Client	Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
10/17/2012 12:18:02	Twitter Web Client	George Will said "best debate he ever saw". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting.
10/17/2012 12:01:27	Twitter Web Client	Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows. 
10/17/2012 2:50:09	Twitter Web Client	Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate
10/17/2012 2:31:46	Twitter Web Client	You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.
10/17/2012 2:23:05	Twitter Web Client	Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
10/17/2012 2:17:33	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.
10/17/2012 2:12:24	Twitter Web Client	Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
10/17/2012 2:12:13	Twitter Web Client	Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
10/17/2012 1:43:29	Twitter Web Client	Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
10/17/2012 1:37:49	Twitter Web Client	Obama just said @MittRomney was "a very successful investor"--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility.
10/17/2012 1:26:42	Twitter Web Client	Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
10/17/2012 1:25:53	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!
10/17/2012 1:13:17	Twitter Web Client	Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
10/17/2012 1:09:27	Twitter Web Client	Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
10/17/2012 1:07:29	Twitter Web Client	Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
10/17/2012 1:07:13	Twitter Web Client	Why hasn't Obama created jobs?
10/17/2012 0:46:19	Twitter Web Client	Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say "let's get ready to rumble"!
10/16/2012 21:37:12	Twitter Web Client	I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment--I agree.
10/16/2012 21:26:28	Twitter Web Client	We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.
10/16/2012 21:11:56	Twitter Web Client	For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
10/16/2012 21:03:42	Twitter Web Client	Great win last night by Peyton Manning &amp; @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. Very impressive.
10/16/2012 21:01:47	Twitter Web Client	If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6&amp; 7 so they will win!
10/16/2012 20:57:46	Twitter Web Client	Get ready for tonight!
10/16/2012 20:11:35	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records &amp; transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.
10/16/2012 19:23:56	Twitter Web Client	Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
10/16/2012 18:49:05	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
10/16/2012 18:47:13	Twitter Web Client	I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.
10/16/2012 18:20:35	Twitter Web Client	Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast &amp; Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President.
10/16/2012 18:16:21	Twitter Web Client	.@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves.
10/16/2012 18:01:26	Twitter Web Client	.@antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep.
10/16/2012 17:54:47	Twitter Web Client	.@History's wonderful "The Men Who Built America" with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing, I'll be live tweeting the debate
10/16/2012 17:50:34	Twitter Web Client	Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.
10/16/2012 17:47:29	Twitter Web Client	The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage.
10/16/2012 17:01:30	Twitter Web Client	It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks!
10/16/2012 16:21:53	Twitter Web Client	Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.
10/16/2012 15:37:45	Twitter Web Client	Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit, I wish the stuff worked.
10/16/2012 15:11:41	Twitter Web Client	.@antbaxter  Thanks for helping promote &amp; make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool!
10/16/2012 15:10:20	Twitter Web Client	.@antbaxter  Your documentary died many deaths. You have, in my opinion, zero talent.
10/16/2012 14:30:49	Twitter Web Client	I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice.
10/16/2012 14:27:26	Twitter Web Client	.@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected.
10/16/2012 14:12:29	Twitter Web Client	Verlander is great but  very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games
10/16/2012 14:08:09	Twitter Web Client	I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.
10/16/2012 13:57:59	Twitter Web Client	I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.
10/16/2012 13:53:35	Twitter Web Client	Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over.
10/16/2012 13:39:57	Twitter Web Client	I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt.
10/16/2012 13:10:45	Twitter Web Client	Gov. Gary Johnson pulling votes from @MittRomney--Don't waste your vote. Obama must go!
10/16/2012 0:48:35	Twitter Web Client	Based on very popular demand, I will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the Presidential debate.
10/15/2012 21:36:13	Twitter Web Client	The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government. -- @MittRomney
10/15/2012 21:25:45	Twitter Web Client	Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride, let time go by.Donald J. Trump
10/15/2012 20:41:12	Twitter Web Client	If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night, Obama is finished!
10/15/2012 20:09:17	Twitter Web Client	Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.
10/15/2012 19:44:51	Twitter Web Client	A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a $30M/yr rip off.
10/15/2012 19:28:06	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.
10/15/2012 16:57:43	Twitter Web Client	Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
10/15/2012 16:55:40	Twitter Web Client	Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
10/15/2012 16:22:53	Twitter Web Client	Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it, it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.
10/15/2012 15:10:56	Twitter Web Client	A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
10/15/2012 14:59:40	Twitter Web Client	Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
10/15/2012 14:10:34	Twitter Web Client	I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!
10/15/2012 13:54:32	Twitter Web Client	A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
10/15/2012 2:24:30	Twitter Web Client	Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
10/15/2012 2:06:13	Twitter Web Client	Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
10/15/2012 1:40:17	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout. 
10/14/2012 18:43:44	Twitter Web Client	I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.
10/14/2012 18:43:02	Twitter Web Client	No, I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go, they win.
10/14/2012 16:44:38	Twitter Web Client	Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.
10/14/2012 16:42:17	Twitter Web Client	A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.
10/14/2012 14:09:32	Twitter Web Client	Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
10/14/2012 13:39:39	Twitter Web Client	.@Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence.
10/14/2012 13:09:24	Twitter Web Client	A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.
10/14/2012 1:34:34	Twitter Web Client	So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.
10/13/2012 21:11:13	Twitter Web Client	Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.
10/13/2012 18:58:28	Twitter Web Client	Tonight, despite everything, put A-Rod in the lineup. 
10/13/2012 18:40:53	Twitter Web Client	Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason. 
10/13/2012 17:38:31	Twitter Web Client	They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
10/13/2012 15:38:01	Twitter Web Client	Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
10/13/2012 15:28:00	Twitter Web Client	I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
10/13/2012 15:13:11	Twitter Web Client	Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.
10/13/2012 14:14:01	Twitter Web Client	When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing".
10/13/2012 0:22:12	Twitter Web Client	I told you, whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.
10/12/2012 20:23:40	Twitter Web Client	Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. -- Warren G. Bennis
10/12/2012 20:09:06	Twitter Web Client	When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important.
10/12/2012 19:53:01	Twitter Web Client	I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again.
10/12/2012 19:35:38	Twitter Web Client	Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.
10/12/2012 19:19:07	Twitter Web Client	What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy. --@PaulRyanVP
10/12/2012 19:03:06	Twitter Web Client	Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.
10/12/2012 18:53:12	Twitter Web Client	With our amazing All Star cast, @Joan_Rivers, @johnrich, @ArsenioOFFICIAL &amp; @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors.
10/12/2012 18:43:26	Twitter Web Client	Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. This will be something special!
10/12/2012 18:33:48	Twitter Web Client	.@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act.
10/12/2012 18:25:57	Twitter Web Client	I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there.
10/12/2012 18:14:55	Twitter Web Client	My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me.
10/12/2012 17:05:08	Twitter Web Client	Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. #VPDebate
10/12/2012 16:55:11	Twitter Web Client	Doing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great- I really like Matt.
10/12/2012 15:40:45	Twitter Web Client	First Minister of Scotland released bomber of Pan Am flight #103 on "compassionate grounds." Do you believe?
10/12/2012 14:28:23	Twitter Web Client	There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still. -- Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt
10/12/2012 13:46:11	Twitter Web Client	ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.
10/12/2012 13:26:15	Twitter Web Client	Wing bangers-- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S.
10/12/2012 12:52:50	Twitter Web Client	British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted &amp; environment destroying Scottish windmills.
10/12/2012 10:56:51	Twitter Web Client	Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.-- watch.
10/12/2012 2:39:37	Twitter Web Client	Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
10/12/2012 1:47:09	Twitter Web Client	Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
10/12/2012 1:29:31	Twitter Web Client	Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate
10/12/2012 1:24:36	Twitter Web Client	Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
10/12/2012 1:13:21	Twitter Web Client	Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
10/12/2012 1:04:30	Twitter Web Client	Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate
10/12/2012 0:54:28	Twitter Web Client	Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate
10/11/2012 23:21:20	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
10/11/2012 20:07:32	Twitter Web Client	It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election. How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today?
10/11/2012 19:57:16	Twitter Web Client	Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U.S. history
10/11/2012 19:55:31	Twitter Web Client	Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate...should be a great time
10/11/2012 19:33:25	Twitter Web Client	How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!
10/11/2012 19:31:16	Twitter Web Client	Why the hell did we help the Libyan "rebels" in the first place. That is the real scandal.
10/11/2012 18:49:03	Twitter Web Client	I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight. Don't be fooled by his gaffes. He is a seasoned and feisty debater.
10/11/2012 18:01:25	Twitter Web Client	If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch!
10/11/2012 16:55:00	Twitter Web Client	Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.
10/11/2012 16:38:46	Twitter Web Client	$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)
10/11/2012 16:14:00	Twitter Web Client	I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero.
10/11/2012 16:02:37	Twitter Web Client	.@Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer
10/11/2012 15:54:48	Twitter Web Client	Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it "mildly" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter.
10/11/2012 15:51:39	Twitter Web Client	Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal
10/11/2012 15:45:46	Twitter Web Client	Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).
10/11/2012 13:00:12	Twitter Web Client	When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -- Henry Ford
10/10/2012 20:40:51	Twitter Web Client	I enjoy meeting tourists in #TrumpTower. People travel from across the world to see the five-level Atrium &amp; waterfall.
10/10/2012 20:27:23	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an "A" grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy. Rick is a fantastic governor.
10/10/2012 20:15:51	Twitter Web Client	I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night!
10/10/2012 20:07:02	Twitter Web Client	You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird.  -- @MittRomney
10/10/2012 19:43:41	Twitter Web Client	A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. He simply can't perform without drugs.
10/10/2012 19:20:14	Twitter Web Client	Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech. The honor was all mine!  Great people.
10/10/2012 18:49:02	Twitter Web Client	47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
10/10/2012 18:04:35	Twitter Web Client	Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media?
10/10/2012 17:07:29	Twitter Web Client	I just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
10/10/2012 16:45:14	Twitter Web Client	27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election, we decide whether we become great again.
10/10/2012 16:08:08	Twitter Web Client	It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes. Be careful of voter fraud!
10/10/2012 15:39:34	Twitter Web Client	Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure.
10/10/2012 15:34:38	Twitter Web Client	Remember, Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful!
10/10/2012 14:53:49	Twitter Web Client	I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
10/10/2012 14:42:46	Twitter Web Client	I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. -- Mitt
10/10/2012 14:00:26	Twitter Web Client	By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate  Thursday night. It will be very interesting, I promise.
10/10/2012 13:28:35	Twitter Web Client	.@DavidLetterman @Late_Show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist. Thank you David--we are again friends.
10/9/2012 22:06:45	Twitter Web Client	The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks…
10/9/2012 21:39:26	Twitter Web Client	Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.  He is desperate.
10/9/2012 21:11:35	Twitter Web Client	Mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner.
10/9/2012 20:26:50	Twitter Web Client	With these record high gas prices, what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate?
10/9/2012 18:37:12	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates. Will be a lot of fun.
10/9/2012 18:29:15	Twitter Web Client	When will the unemployment numbers be corrected? Sadly, after the election!
10/9/2012 17:43:38	Twitter Web Client	George Will is a political moron. Last month he said Romney couldn't win.
10/9/2012 17:27:49	Twitter Web Client	In the end, Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens. I like him again, a lot.
10/9/2012 17:23:10	Twitter Web Client	Drop A-Rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use. Also, not a pressure player.
10/9/2012 17:12:10	Twitter Web Client	Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices?
10/9/2012 17:11:27	Twitter Web Client	California gas prices going thru the roof, others to follow. An election-losing event for Obama.
10/9/2012 15:34:29	Twitter Web Client	Greece should get out of the euro &amp; go back to their own currency--they are just wasting time.
10/9/2012 15:26:51	Twitter Web Client	.@ErraticSLK  Shout out = work hard!
10/9/2012 15:02:25	Twitter Web Client	.@carlosbeltran15 is playing great for St. Louis Cardinals. They made a wise decision.
10/9/2012 14:47:54	Twitter Web Client	.@jack_welch is correct--these reporters would not have been so brave while Jack was running GE.
10/9/2012 14:39:49	Twitter Web Client	Our many loyal viewers should expect a major announcement very soon on next season's @CelebApprentice. Our fans will be pleased.
10/9/2012 14:11:38	Twitter Web Client	Sleepy eyes @chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you.
10/8/2012 20:02:48	Twitter Web Client	How long did it take for Obama to call Hugo Chavez and congratulate him on his 'reelection?' Who do you think Chavez supports in ours?
10/8/2012 19:58:09	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @NFL record with 48 consecutive games with a TD pass. He is a great guy and player.
10/8/2012 19:55:24	Twitter Web Client	At the request of many- I will be doing live tweets during the next presidential debate.
10/8/2012 19:39:34	Twitter Web Client	Sleepy eyes @chucktodd is an absolute joke of a reporter. He is in the bag for Obama. He can't carry @jack_welch's jock.
10/8/2012 19:32:09	Twitter Web Client	Who is more believable on the state of employment--the great @jack_welch or some government bureaucrat who is voting for Obama?
10/8/2012 13:13:38	Twitter Web Client	Got to do something about these missing chidlren grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents--fast trial, death penalty.
10/5/2012 20:38:44	Twitter Web Client	More than 70M people watched the Presidential Debate.  A new record.  See what happens when I am so prominently mentioned (just kidding)!
10/5/2012 19:06:50	Twitter Web Client	.@acuconservative's #CPACCO kept up the momentum from the debate. @MittRomney even made a surprise appearance. Now go win CO!
10/5/2012 18:39:04	Twitter Web Client	Now America knows--the Emperor has no clothes. Why would Obama do better in a 2nd debate? #Debate #Obama
10/5/2012 18:06:55	Twitter Web Client	My friend @GovChristie called it--@MittRomney recast the race.
10/5/2012 16:48:11	Twitter Web Client	Glad to hear that @RobinRoberts is doing well. She is a terrific person.
10/5/2012 16:44:48	Twitter Web Client	I promise to do a new #trumpvlog when I get back next week---- lots of requests. Thanks!
10/4/2012 20:12:51	Twitter Web Client	To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction. --Isaac Newton
10/4/2012 19:22:16	Twitter Web Client	Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. --@MittRomney
10/4/2012 18:52:50	Twitter Web Client	Bill Clinton has been Obama's most effective surrogate out on the trail.
10/4/2012 18:51:54	Twitter Web Client	Congrats to @Yankees on finishing 1st in the AL East. Derek Jeter is great--good luck in the playoffs!
10/4/2012 18:00:10	Twitter Web Client	The upcoming season of @CelebApprentice will be terrific--a great cast.
10/4/2012 15:43:44	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to Michelle and Barack Obama on their 20th anniversary.
10/4/2012 15:31:52	Twitter Web Client	Happy to have just passed 1.5M followers on twitter. We picked up over 14,000 yesterday alone. It's great to speak to everyone daily.
10/4/2012 15:21:14	Twitter Web Client	I'm eagerly awaiting the next polls. The debate performance could be devastating to the Obama team. Let's see what happens.
10/4/2012 14:29:25	Twitter Web Client	Both being optimistic and remembering the big picture have served me well throughout my life. You need to stay positive.
10/4/2012 13:59:22	Twitter Web Client	.@SethMacFarlane will be a great Oscar host. He did an amazing job at my @ComedyCentral roast.
10/4/2012 13:21:23	Twitter Web Client	Wind farms are ugly, not cost effective and don't produce worthwhile returns or energy. No wonder governments are giving up on them.
10/4/2012 3:12:57	Twitter Web Client	As a big job creator, I was greatly honored to have been mentioned twice tonight during the debate.
10/4/2012 3:12:01	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to Mitt Romney. He was not only good, he was absolutely fantastic tonight!
10/3/2012 20:57:52	Twitter Web Client	Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack. --Sun Tzu
10/3/2012 20:51:46	Twitter Web Client	There's only one candidate who cut medicare and that's Barack Obama. Cut over $700M to move into ObamaCare.
10/3/2012 20:10:15	Twitter Web Client	Have you heard? China just told Obama to jump. Obama asked how high.
10/3/2012 19:44:44	Twitter Web Client	Obama's '07 speech which @DailyCaller just released not only shows that Obama is a racist but also how the press always covers for him.
10/3/2012 19:29:22	Twitter Web Client	I'm always amazed when I travel to my foreign properties.Seeing the Trump brand across 4 continents proves that excellence can be universal.
10/3/2012 18:48:49	Twitter Web Client	Who is rooting for Obama more tonight--his campaign advisors or the press?
10/3/2012 18:45:58	Twitter Web Client	Can't wait for tonight's debate--actually delayed my trip to Europe so I can watch. This is going to be a great night.

10/3/2012 15:39:23	Twitter Web Client	Reverend Wright must have great hatred for Obama and the manner in which he was shunted aside.
10/3/2012 15:25:01	Twitter Web Client	Obama called Reverend Wright his friend, counselor &amp; great leader--then dumped him like a dog!
10/3/2012 15:15:31	Twitter Web Client	See June 2007 speech--is Obama a total racist?
10/3/2012 13:37:27	Twitter Web Client	The cheap 12 inch sq. marble tiles behind speaker at UN always bothered me. I will replace with beautiful large marble slabs if they ask me.
10/3/2012 13:23:45	Twitter Web Client	Where is the main stream media reporting on Univision's new expose of Fast and Furious? Too busy looking at Mitt's taxes?

10/2/2012 20:47:29	Twitter Web Client	It's Tuesday, how much will the media continue to cover up the embassy attacks for Obama?

10/2/2012 20:17:58	Twitter Web Client	Great to hear that @nfl legend and hall of famer John Elway has endorsed @MittRomney in Colorado. CO is a must win state for Mitt.
10/2/2012 19:24:37	Twitter Web Client	Under Obama, Iran has taken over Iraq, Al Qaeda has taken over Libya, the Muslim Brotherhood now controls Egypt. Worst  foreign policy ever.
10/2/2012 19:08:02	Twitter Web Client	Woody Johnson's comments that he would rather have @MittRomney win the election than his @nyjets win games shows real patriotism.
10/2/2012 18:55:47	Twitter Web Client	The Chinese are now hacking White House computers. Why not? They already own the place.
10/2/2012 18:45:28	Twitter Web Client	Big win by @Yankees last night to take control of AL East. Jeter &amp; company now control their destiny.

10/2/2012 15:49:26	Twitter Web Client	If Obama mentions Mitt's tax returns in tomorrow's debate then Mitt should immediately ask for Obama's college records &amp; applications
10/2/2012 14:38:26	Twitter Web Client	Al Qaeda taking over Libya after we made it possible--really amazing.

10/2/2012 13:38:34	Twitter Web Client	Obama now wants to give another $450M to the Muslim Brotherhood. Money we don't have going to people that hate us. Moronic.
10/2/2012 13:23:59	Twitter Web Client	How many more of our soldiers have to be shot by the Afghanis they are training? Let's get the hell out of there and focus on U.S.

10/1/2012 20:53:58	Twitter Web Client	Obama deserves much less credit for the killing of Bin Laden. The praise goes to our brave military and intelligence officers.

10/1/2012 19:34:55	Twitter Web Client	Only 36 days until the election. @MittRomney needs to stay on offense. Make Obama's terrible record the issue. #TimeToGetTough
10/1/2012 19:21:07	Twitter Web Client	In debate, @MittRomney should ask Obama why autobiography states "born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia."
10/1/2012 14:37:44	Twitter Web Client	Obama lied to the public about the Al Qaeda attack on our consulate in Libya. He should be held accountable.

9/27/2012 20:05:37	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney must ask for Obama's college records &amp; applications--why is he not doing this?
9/27/2012 19:43:20	Twitter Web Client	ObamaCare is a failure. Costs are rising much faster under Obama than other Presidents.
9/27/2012 18:49:02	Twitter Web Client	A resort in Arizona is using sewage to make snow. Environmentalists are going crazy--I won't be skiing in that snow.

9/27/2012 18:08:53	Twitter Web Client	Does Madonna know something we all don't about Barack? At a concert she said "we have a black Muslim in the White House."
9/27/2012 16:21:52	Twitter Web Client	Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game. -- The Art of the Deal
9/27/2012 16:00:55	Twitter Web Client	How long will it take for chants-- "bring back the replacement refs" -- when a bad call is made?

9/27/2012 15:55:10	Twitter Web Client	40 days until the election. Crunch time. @MittRomney must stay on offense and take the fight to Obama.
9/27/2012 1:25:50	Twitter Web Client	Jerry Falwell, Jr. stated speech was best in University's history...my great honor.
9/27/2012 1:24:52	Twitter Web Client	Liberty University speech by DJT was biggest by far in school's history. Standing ovations...great young people!
9/27/2012 1:23:49	Twitter Web Client	Associated Press knowingly and inaccurately wrote about Liberty University speech. Shameful reporting...no credibility.
9/27/2012 1:22:14	Twitter Web Client	Huff post gets it wrong re: Ferry Point...the only leakage of gas is from Arianna Huffington.
9/26/2012 21:33:11	Twitter Web Client	No matter how good the replacement refs do, they will be soundly criticized--they can't win!
9/26/2012 20:41:28	Twitter Web Client	China has done very well under Obama. Now they just released their first aircraft carrier.

9/26/2012 15:20:24	Twitter Web Client	Aspirin gets the best press of almost anything I can think of---fact or great PR?
9/26/2012 15:11:01	Twitter Web Client	Obama's complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS since he had full control for two years. He can never take responsibility.
9/26/2012 14:12:19	Twitter Web Client	.@brandonhardest  Love what you do and work hard.
9/26/2012 14:10:01	Twitter Web Client	Andy Williams has died. He was a friend of mine and a great guy.

9/25/2012 19:11:34	Twitter Web Client	Obama will be going on @theviewtv &amp; fundraising while in NYC for the UN Assembly...
9/25/2012 19:11:23	Twitter Web Client	...yet not one meeting with an ally (or an enemy!) Where's the media?
9/25/2012 18:44:35	Twitter Web Client	...well into our 4th week of shooting the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice. The 'All Stars' are hard at work...
9/25/2012 18:43:31	Twitter Web Client	Did a shoot in front of the Metropolitian Museum on 5th Ave for the 13th season of the Apprentice...
9/25/2012 18:40:48	Twitter Web Client	The replacement refs are getting blamed for everything. I've seen many bad sports calls over the years.
9/25/2012 18:33:06	Twitter Web Client	One 57 is one of the worst looking buildings I've seen in a long time, in particular its very ugly "skin."
9/25/2012 17:59:05	Twitter Web Client	Emmys telecast is way down &amp; lowest telecast on record among young adults. Emmys have no credibility-Should have nominated Apprentice again!

9/25/2012 15:10:13	Twitter Web Client	Muslim Brotherhood head of Egypt Morsi is already making demands on Obama before the WH visit. Obama's foreign policy is a complete failure.
9/25/2012 14:47:19	Twitter Web Client	Home values have sunk a record 15% under Obama.
9/25/2012 14:45:06	Twitter Web Client	The debates are going to have a big impact on the election. @MittRomney has proved--in Florida--he delivers under pressure.
9/25/2012 14:06:55	Twitter Web Client	Scary--Obama's budget deficits are so out of control that he has to borrow 40 cents on every dollar he spends.
9/24/2012 20:41:55	Twitter Web Client	RT @MittRomney: I am running for president to get us creating wealth again--not to redistribute it.
9/24/2012 20:35:29	Twitter Web Client	With Obama and Bernanke destroying the value of the dollar, gold and real estate should continue to rise in value.
9/24/2012 20:18:19	Twitter Web Client	The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11. Time for Obama to come clean.
9/24/2012 20:16:20	Twitter Web Client	Despite all of China's cheating, they are not doing that well--we can beat them--our country has great potential!
9/24/2012 19:49:44	Twitter Web Client	All these polls released by news outlets are oversampling Democrats. They want to influence public perception of the race.
9/24/2012 19:36:48	Twitter Web Client	The Emmys are all politics, that's why, despite nominations, The Apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over.
9/24/2012 19:19:22	Twitter Web Client	Amazing Race winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility--no wonder the ratings are at record lows.
9/24/2012 19:12:51	Twitter Web Client	The Emmys were horrendous...the absolute worst show!
9/24/2012 17:45:09	Twitter Web Client	With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy, Obama should be down by 12 points--and he's not.
9/24/2012 17:22:50	Twitter Web Client	The Republican Party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials. They must be tough and smart.
9/24/2012 17:21:58	Twitter Web Client	Why did @MittRomney give his tax returns without demanding that Obama release his college records &amp; applications in return?
9/24/2012 17:15:40	Twitter Web Client	Just left Liberty University. Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr.&amp; his father have done an amazing job...great school &amp; the students were fantastic
9/24/2012 17:04:45	Twitter Web Client	The Ryder Cup will be amazing this week.

9/20/2012 19:28:54	Twitter Web Client	It is now clear that the Embassy attack in Libya was a coordinated Al Qaeda operation and not based on some video.
9/20/2012 18:46:14	Twitter Web Client	Yesterday I was in Washington, D.C. visiting the #TRUMP Old Post Office renovation. It will be magnificent.
9/19/2012 21:14:58	Twitter Web Client	Isn’t it great that Obama had time yesterday to fundraise with Jay Z and do @Late_Show while there is a record 21% real unemployment!
9/19/2012 20:40:48	Twitter Web Client	QE3, a political favor for Obama, will cause record inflation on food and fuel.  This hits low income families the hardest. Big mistake.
9/19/2012 18:33:29	Twitter Web Client	Have you seen the new #Trump fall collection exclusively available @Macys? Top selling brand nationwide.Ties, shirts, fragrance-great gifts.
9/19/2012 17:18:59	Twitter Web Client	...come down hard--tax the hell out of their imports and reduce our deficit fast.
9/19/2012 17:18:35	Twitter Web Client	China has been unfairly subsidizing the export of cars &amp; auto parts. I've been saying this for 3 years...
9/19/2012 17:08:42	Twitter Web Client	Don't let them build a wind turbine in your backyard (or near your house). It will destroy your property value.
9/19/2012 16:07:45	Twitter Web Client	Oil would be $25 a barrel if our government would let us drill. Our country would be rich again--who needs OPEC.
9/19/2012 14:59:48	Twitter Web Client	Technology has shown we have tremendous energy resources right under our feet that we didn't know about 5 years ago.
9/19/2012 14:10:05	Twitter Web Client	The stage is set for the real debate--it will be very interesting!
9/19/2012 14:01:47	Twitter Web Client	Obama should play golf with Republicans &amp; opponents rather than his small group of friends. That way maybe the terrible gridlock would end.
9/19/2012 12:54:45	Twitter Web Client	Filming for @CelebApprentice Season 13 is now into the 2nd week. The 'All-Star' cast is already hard at work.
9/19/2012 12:42:45	Twitter Web Client	Obama killed over 100k jobs by not approving Keystone XL pipeline and Canada is now selling the oil to China--very dumb!
9/18/2012 20:52:02	Twitter Web Client	I'll be on @gretawire tonight at 10 PM Fox News
9/18/2012 20:30:20	Twitter Web Client	Can you believe--they are blaming @MittRomney for Egypt.

9/18/2012 20:26:00	Twitter Web Client	.@lightjzup  Industrial turbines are destroying our land.
9/18/2012 20:15:19	Twitter Web Client	Liberal press won't look into why Obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with Romney's private comments.
9/18/2012 20:05:13	Twitter Web Client	None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster. 20% real unemployment and $6T in deficit spending.
9/18/2012 19:34:56	Twitter Web Client	It's Tuesday. How many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores Obama's record?
9/18/2012 19:27:33	Twitter Web Client	The majority of Americans agree with @MittRomney's comments on @Israel and Iran.
9/18/2012 19:23:10	Twitter Web Client	With 49 days until the election, @MittRomney needs to stay on offense. He should not be apologizing. Deflect onto Obama's record.
9/18/2012 14:51:42	Twitter Web Client	@princeetornam They had both interest and aptitude. They've done a terrific job.
9/18/2012 14:37:37	Twitter Web Client	@rdowns I never went bankrupt. Enemies love to say I did. Didn't happen.

9/17/2012 20:22:40	Twitter Web Client	Still a buyer's market. Buy directly from a bank. They want to offload properties that have defaulted, will give good prices &amp; financing.
9/17/2012 20:18:26	Twitter Web Client	Eli Manning staged a great comeback in 4th quarter--an elite quarterback.

9/17/2012 19:53:13	Twitter Web Client	Teachers in Chicago should go back to work immediately.Rahm Emanuel has offered them a fair deal. Now they're just acting for the cameras.
9/17/2012 19:48:06	Twitter Web Client	Gas prices have doubled under Obama. Over $5/gallon now in California. We must start drilling from our own resources to become independent.
9/17/2012 19:12:21	Twitter Web Client	Obama is our unlucky President. Everything he touches turns into a mess. Some people just don't have it!
9/17/2012 18:16:32	Twitter Web Client	After being ripped off for years, Obama finally figured out that China is taking advantage of us. He's finally listening to me.
9/17/2012 18:03:00	Twitter Web Client	Kate Middleton is great--but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude--only herself to blame.
9/17/2012 17:58:36	Twitter Web Client	Occupy Wall Street is at it again- go out and get a job. It's actually easier work and far more rewarding.

9/14/2012 19:22:04	Twitter Web Client	@Shawn_Maynard  This is our 13th season. No precise date yet but most likely in the early spring. Shooting is underway. Will be terrific.
9/14/2012 18:40:53	Twitter Web Client	RT @MittRomney: For nearly 4 years, Barack Obama has refused to crack down on China's cheating &amp; American workers have paid the price.
9/14/2012 18:32:38	Twitter Web Client	Why doesn't Obama let our marines who are guarding the embassies in Egypt have live ammunition? They need it fast.
9/14/2012 18:30:06	Twitter Web Client	It's amazing--@hardball_chris has completely lost all connections to reality. He is a complete shill for Obama.
9/14/2012 17:16:53	Twitter Web Client	Oh no, another rapper doing a Trump song --"Young Jeezy - Trump Lyrics." Why aren't these guys paying me?
9/14/2012 15:55:38	Twitter Web Client	@BuckingSlams  Sam, you're 100% correct. Frankly I wish they'd scram.
9/14/2012 15:32:12	Twitter Web Client	I hate @USAToday's redesign--the logo is terrible. Lightweight Al Neuharth must've had something to do with this No wonder paper is failing.

9/13/2012 18:40:21	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney should continue to stay on offense on the embassy issue. Obama, who put these radicals in power, deserves blame.
9/13/2012 18:21:26	Twitter Web Client	It's Thursday, how many more bias press reports will be released against @MittRomney?
9/13/2012 17:50:22	Twitter Web Client	Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?
9/13/2012 17:48:02	Twitter Web Client	I will be speaking Monday, September 24, (10 A.M.) at Liberty University, to a record setting student body. I look forward to it!
9/13/2012 17:29:01	Twitter Web Client	The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney.
9/13/2012 17:15:03	Twitter Web Client	What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
9/13/2012 17:13:27	Twitter Web Client	With allies like Egypt and Libya, who needs enemies?!
9/13/2012 17:10:04	Twitter Web Client	Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?
9/13/2012 16:59:19	Twitter Web Client	Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally. They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak.
9/13/2012 16:46:31	Twitter Web Client	Filming of the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice has started. Be sure to be on the lookout for future updates.
9/13/2012 14:27:39	Twitter Web Client	If Obama was smart, he would cancel the Muslim Brotherhood's WH visit later this month. He won't.
9/13/2012 14:00:18	Twitter Web Client	With the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food.
9/13/2012 13:57:47	Twitter Web Client	Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had.
9/13/2012 13:15:48	Twitter Web Client	We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy. Great going Obama--Israel is in trouble.
9/13/2012 13:14:42	Twitter Web Client	This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President.
9/13/2012 13:01:35	Twitter Web Client	Weakness, cow towing and not standing firm is provocative. We are getting pushed around and robbed under this President.
9/13/2012 12:52:58	Twitter Web Client	The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. -- Vince Lombardi
9/12/2012 20:39:56	Twitter Web Client	Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP. If Obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013.
9/12/2012 20:20:46	Twitter Web Client	Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President. Obama=Carter.
9/12/2012 20:16:48	Twitter Web Client	I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out. The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11. Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing?
9/12/2012 20:04:52	Twitter Web Client	Those who refuse to draw red line to Iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @Israel. -- @IsraeliPM @netanyahu
9/12/2012 19:46:20	Twitter Web Client	Obama will go down as the worst President in history on many topics but especially foreign policy.
9/11/2012 19:46:10	Twitter Web Client	If Obama wins it is the end of the Republican party. -- @limbaugh
9/11/2012 19:44:36	Twitter Web Client	Amazing. @CelebApprentice has started filming our record 13th season this week thanks to our big and very loyal fan base.
9/11/2012 19:08:28	Twitter Web Client	Why won't Obama release his college applications? Is there something 'foreign' about them?
9/11/2012 18:40:14	Twitter Web Client	84% of US troops wounded &amp; 70% of our brave men &amp; women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama. Time to get out of there.
9/11/2012 18:20:20	Twitter Web Client	Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration? Where's the media?
9/11/2012 18:18:08	Twitter Web Client	The onus of the Chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers &amp; their union. Inexcusable to leave children without school.
9/11/2012 17:44:57	Twitter Web Client	On this solemn day of remembrance we can all take joy in the fact that Bin Laden's last sight was a Navy SEAL pulling the trigger.
9/11/2012 15:35:42	Twitter Web Client	Today we remember and honor our fellow Americans and NYPD and FDNY who fell 11 years ago.
9/11/2012 13:44:54	Twitter Web Client	You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals.--General George S. Patton
9/10/2012 20:48:03	Twitter Web Client	President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people--Clint Eastwood
9/7/2012 20:02:29	Twitter Web Client	You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life. -- Winston Churchill
9/7/2012 19:33:49	Twitter Web Client	I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM. Tune in!
9/7/2012 19:23:50	Twitter Web Client	One of the best moves I ever made was staying out of last decade's artificial real estate boom. But I used the downturn to my advantage.
9/7/2012 17:54:26	Twitter Web Client	A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC. Next week we start filming the record 13th seasonHence, go with your gut!
9/7/2012 17:21:58	Twitter Web Client	If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2%
9/7/2012 15:58:41	Twitter Web Client	Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force &amp; have stopped looking for work.Not a real recovery, phony numbers
9/7/2012 15:48:53	Twitter Web Client	There are now 119,000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July. The economy is still terrible.
9/7/2012 15:30:00	Twitter Web Client	Today's job report is dismal. Now a record 88,921,000 Americans are no longer in the work force.
9/7/2012 15:24:07	Twitter Web Client	Drew Peterson, a real sleaze, just convicted of killing wife. Change the law so he gets death penalty.
9/7/2012 15:00:22	Twitter Web Client	Dems had a very good and professional convention. The Republicans must be smart and tough--and fast!
9/7/2012 14:48:16	Twitter Web Client	The Republicans must get Virgil Goode out of the race in Virginia. He will take votes away from @MittRomney.
9/6/2012 20:20:28	Twitter Web Client	Under @BarackObama, 1 out of every 7 Americans is on food stamps.
9/6/2012 20:04:57	Twitter Web Client	Scary--while @BarackObama has been POTUS for 1.6% of America's history, he has amassed 33.3% of the total debt.
9/6/2012 19:53:57	Twitter Web Client	We've gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion -- @MittRomney
9/6/2012 19:36:11	Twitter Web Client	Forty-seven million now on food stamps. When he came to office there were 32 million. He's added 15 million people. --@MittRomney
9/6/2012 18:52:14	Twitter Web Client	Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.
9/6/2012 18:11:52	Twitter Web Client	After @BarackObama's speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released.
9/6/2012 17:59:56	Twitter Web Client	The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting "Four More Years." Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt?
9/6/2012 17:25:38	Twitter Web Client	Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium. Pretty convenient.
9/6/2012 15:47:47	Twitter Web Client	Iran is flying supply planes to Syria through Iraqi airspace. Thank you, United States, for making this possible!
9/6/2012 13:51:44	Twitter Web Client	Bill Clinton did a great job last night--the Democrats are lucky to have him. Do you really believe he likes @BarackObama?
9/5/2012 19:58:45	Twitter Web Client	Other networks are begging me to do a show--I can't because I'm doing the Apprentice!
9/5/2012 19:41:15	Twitter Web Client	Change before you have to. --Jack Welch
9/5/2012 19:21:20	Twitter Web Client	Scary thought--is the sexual pervert Anthony Weiner now in Charlotte? Did he bring his phone with him?
9/5/2012 19:17:43	Twitter Web Client	The Democrats dropped all references to God from their platform. Not good!
9/5/2012 19:04:39	Twitter Web Client	Have you seen the new #TRUMP line of clothing, apparel and fragrances @Macy's? Selling like hotcakes. Great for Christmas gifts, etc.
9/5/2012 18:48:26	Twitter Web Client	Better off? The $16T US debt works out to $136,260 per household, a 50% increase since @BarackObama took office.
9/5/2012 18:26:43	Twitter Web Client	North Carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people. I enjoy my time there when I visit Trump National Charlotte.
9/5/2012 18:24:21	Twitter Web Client	I wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the Democrats in Charlotte right now.
9/5/2012 17:59:03	Twitter Web Client	Almost every T.V. show is asking me to go on--especially the @Late_Show. It's simple--I get the ratings!
9/5/2012 17:36:34	Twitter Web Client	With all the talk of fiscal responsibility at the @DNC convention yesterday, it was ironic that the debt passed $16T.
9/5/2012 15:28:30	Twitter Web Client	.@lancearmstrong, revise your decision to quit--go back and fight.
9/5/2012 15:24:37	Twitter Web Client	Why does US doping agency destroy an American icon, @lancearmstrong, for events that took place years ago in France?
9/5/2012 15:23:51	Twitter Web Client	.@lancearmstrong teammate is angry and jealous--he is no Lance.
9/5/2012 15:09:29	Twitter Web Client	Very good speech by @MichelleObama--and under great pressure--Dems should be proud!
9/5/2012 14:26:11	Twitter Web Client	July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months. Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year.
9/5/2012 14:21:16	Twitter Web Client	What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?
9/5/2012 13:36:57	Twitter Web Client	OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous!
9/5/2012 13:31:46	Twitter Web Client	The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. They have stolen even more from us in jobs &amp; trade during @BarackObama's term.
9/4/2012 20:23:48	Twitter Web Client	NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama, 0% @MittRomney.Even worse than Hillary's old numbers. Is that racism?
9/4/2012 20:15:18	Twitter Web Client	With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention, @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. Scary.
9/4/2012 19:56:41	Twitter Web Client	Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we're really looking dumb. Lots of $'s being made on us.
9/4/2012 19:51:51	Twitter Web Client	The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info.
9/4/2012 19:48:58	Twitter Web Client	Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres. Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote.
9/4/2012 19:04:13	Twitter Web Client	Is this Hope &amp; Change? A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June. We must do better.
9/4/2012 19:02:22	Twitter Web Client	Why does @BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane? He is more than welcomed to come for a ride.
9/4/2012 18:24:24	Twitter Web Client	Joe Paterno's family should sue the idiots @PennState that made that ridiculous deal--and commissioned the one sided report.
9/4/2012 13:13:49	Twitter Web Client	Be  yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected. -- Steve Jobs
9/2/2012 22:19:14	Twitter Web Client	As I predicted 1 year ago, gasoline prices hit a record high today...OPEC is having a ball at our expense.
9/2/2012 22:16:30	Twitter Web Client	Great going Andy Roddick! Another victory for a fabulous player. Brooklyn Decker is good luck.
9/2/2012 19:20:36	Twitter Web Client	I win awards for speaking-but the enemies either won't comment or will say only bad...leave Clint alone!
9/2/2012 19:18:57	Twitter Web Client	If you have a speech-one that would put Winston Churchill to shame, liberals would find a way to make it sound terrible!
9/1/2012 18:34:43	Twitter Web Client	@MELANIATRUMP on @QVC tonight with her fabulous Melania Timepieces &amp; Jewelry. Tune in at 1AM EST!
9/1/2012 13:09:31	Twitter Web Client	Republicans are always saying Obama is such a nice guy. When will they learn that he is not?
9/1/2012 2:23:07	Twitter Web Client	Andy Roddick...a great tennis player is a fantastic guy with a wonderful wife.
8/31/2012 22:36:21	Twitter Web Client	Republicans should have been much tougher on Obama. Just wait until you see what Obama does to Romney at the DNC!
8/31/2012 17:40:12	Twitter Web Client	.@BarackObama's assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China." --@MittRomney
8/31/2012 17:19:56	Twitter Web Client	I am sure the Chinese are getting anxious. They watch the polls. @MittRomney won't let them cheat us anymore.
8/31/2012 17:13:00	Twitter Web Client	We have all the cards. Now is the time to make a great deal with Iran.
8/31/2012 17:06:53	Twitter Web Client	.@GovMikeHuckabee was great the other night. People love him.
8/31/2012 17:01:30	Twitter Web Client	Obama's ideas don't move us 'Forward,' they take us 'Backwards.' These are ideas people come to America to get away from. --@marcorubio
8/31/2012 16:33:01	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney's entire life and career have  built  prosperity and growth.
8/31/2012 16:28:08	Twitter Web Client	I loved watching Clint Eastwood last night--he was terrific!
8/31/2012 14:22:28	Twitter Web Client	If you accept the expectations of others, especially negative ones, then you will never change the outcome.  -- Michael Jordan
8/31/2012 13:17:11	Twitter Web Client	Gas prices are about to hit a record high during the Labor Day weekend. @BarackObama could have stopped this.
8/31/2012 12:56:05	Twitter Web Client	It's Friday, how many advertisers dropped @HuffPost today?
8/30/2012 20:11:25	Twitter Web Client	A fact--golfers don't get aches &amp; pains like others who don't golf. It is amazingly remedial.
8/30/2012 20:06:03	Twitter Web Client	Of course @hardball_chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @CondoleezzaRice's speech. Chris has completely lost it.
8/30/2012 19:32:30	Twitter Web Client	Letterman @Late_Show begging me to go back on his low rated show--calls lots--must apologize for racist comment.
8/30/2012 18:49:51	Twitter Web Client	I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President.
8/30/2012 18:29:44	Twitter Web Client	Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie.
8/30/2012 18:06:05	Twitter Web Client	I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate.
8/30/2012 17:42:48	Twitter Web Client	After four  years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney. @PaulRyanVP
8/30/2012 17:33:57	Twitter Web Client	The dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil!
8/30/2012 17:16:55	Twitter Web Client	Let me say it as clearly as possible, that the attack on my Catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me. -- @GovMike Huckabee
8/30/2012 17:14:39	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @GovMikeHuckabee on last night's tremendous speech. Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better.
8/30/2012 14:14:12	Twitter Web Client	Only two weeks until we start shooting @CelebApprentice. We really have something amazing for the fans this year.
8/30/2012 14:00:22	Twitter Web Client	Gas prices are way too high. With an economy contracting and lower demand, how do OPEC &amp; the speculators get away with this?!
8/30/2012 13:03:02	Twitter Web Client	It's Thursday and again I ask--how much money is China stealing from us?
8/30/2012 12:59:01	Twitter Web Client	I was putting together my early deals in New York &amp; I was advised by many that I was too young. Believe in yourself &amp; you can do anything.
8/29/2012 19:01:49	Twitter Web Client	I am astonished that the media continues to lie. @BarackObama gutted welfare reform. It is a fact!
8/29/2012 18:09:52	Twitter Web Client	America needs @MittRomney and @PaulRyanVP and we need them right now. -- @GovChristie
8/29/2012 17:58:48	Twitter Web Client	No one will work harder. No one will move heaven and earth like Mitt Romney to make this country a better place to live! -- @AnnDRomney
8/29/2012 17:47:04	Twitter Web Client	New business start-ups at the lowest level in 30 years and the EPA is now the Employment Prevention Agency. -- @bobmcdonnell
8/29/2012 17:17:28	Twitter Web Client	It's Wednesday, how much money is China stealing from us today?
8/29/2012 17:07:15	Twitter Web Client	Great speech by my good friend @GovChristie. He did something you won't hear at @BarackObama's convention---tell the truth.
8/29/2012 16:19:29	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @AnnDRomney on delivering a knock out speech last night. America can't wait to call her our First Lady.
8/29/2012 14:21:26	Twitter Web Client	China must be worried that @MittRomney will win this November. They have never had such a pushover like @BarackObama.
8/29/2012 13:06:59	Twitter Web Client	.@BarackObama's dismal job record is reason alone that he must be defeated this November.
8/28/2012 20:47:27	Twitter Web Client	I am very worried that if @BarackObama is re-elected then Medicare will be destroyed. We must take care of our seniors.
8/28/2012 19:51:14	Twitter Web Client	I stand ready to lead us down a new path, where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed, not by a resentment of success. -- @MittRomney
8/28/2012 19:28:59	Twitter Web Client	It's Tuesday--how much inflation has @BarackObama's spending caused today on the price of food and gas?
8/28/2012 19:19:37	Twitter Web Client	.@GovChristie is going to do a fantastic job tonight explaining why @MittRomney  should be elected and @BarackObama has to go.
8/28/2012 19:07:26	Twitter Web Client	.@MELANIATRUMP and I are looking forward to watching @AnnDRomney's speech tonight. She is an amazing woman who will be a great First Lady!
8/28/2012 19:04:09	Twitter Web Client	Happy to hear that @ralphreed's Faith and Freedom chapters are at the @RNC convention supporting @MittRomney. We must be united to win!
8/28/2012 18:50:24	Twitter Web Client	Remember when @ariannahuff ran for Governor of California. She got 3 votes.
8/28/2012 18:35:27	Twitter Web Client	Ask China if their rapidly expanding (with our money) Navy or Armed Forces are going "green" -- They would laugh in your face!
8/28/2012 18:24:20	Twitter Web Client	.@RobinRoberts everyone adores you- including me- get well fast!
8/28/2012 16:02:49	Twitter Web Client	The Bay Bridge in San Francisco is being built by the Chinese--tremendous cost overruns. A total mess. We should build our own bridges, etc
8/28/2012 15:51:55	Twitter Web Client	Don't think my statement on @ariannahuff was harsh, if you knew her and the phony Huffington Post you would understand--- more to follow.
8/28/2012 14:54:06	Twitter Web Client	.@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.
8/28/2012 14:19:49	Twitter Web Client	The US Navy wants to go "green." Our Navy should use the best &amp; most powerful fuel &amp; not play games. Give me a break!
8/28/2012 13:59:45	Twitter Web Client	As usual, the weather people got it wrong in Tampa. They just look for headlines &amp; ratings!
8/28/2012 13:37:25	Twitter Web Client	Media silent when @BarackObama  called @MittRomney a murderer &amp; felon. Mitt mentions 'birth certificate' and they go nuts. Double standard!
8/28/2012 12:45:42	Twitter Web Client	They succeed, because they think they can. -- Virgil
8/27/2012 19:35:52	Twitter Web Client	It is very sad to see what @BarackObama has done with NASA. He has gutted the program and made us dependent on the Russians.
8/27/2012 19:29:33	Twitter Web Client	Sorry to hear of the passing of Neil Armstrong over the weekend. He was an American hero.
8/27/2012 19:16:00	Twitter Web Client	One point I made last night and will continue to push is that the @GOP can't be pollitically correct. We must fight fire with fire.
8/27/2012 17:41:15	Twitter Web Client	I knew Chris Matthews when he was sane and, quite honestly, wonderful. Now he's gone off the deep end as an Obama surrogate. @hardball_chris
8/27/2012 15:58:43	Twitter Web Client	Why do the Republicans keep apologizing on the so called "birther" issue? No more apologies--take the offensive!
8/27/2012 15:20:44	Twitter Web Client	The toughest thing about success is that you've got to keep on being a success. --Irving Berlin
8/27/2012 14:58:28	Twitter Web Client	.@BarackObama is begging the Eurozone to keep Greece in until after 11.6.12. He thinks the world revolves around his re-election.
8/27/2012 14:23:16	Twitter Web Client	.@BarackObama sent over 100,000 jobs and Canadian oil to China all because he would not approve Keystone XL.
8/24/2012 20:16:35	Twitter Web Client	I am sure the @NCGOP will do a great job bracketing the @DNC convention. They are a tremendous statewide organization.
8/24/2012 19:55:18	Twitter Web Client	It's Friday. How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today? They are an environmental &amp; aesthetic disaster.
8/24/2012 19:40:55	Twitter Web Client	.@DineshDSouza's '2016: Obama's America' is expanding to over 1,000 theaters this weekend. Will be highest grossing documentary in 2012. !!
8/24/2012 19:24:04	Twitter Web Client	Florida has been very good to me. I am really esxcited to give back at the Sarasota GOP event and @RNC convention. Will be fun!
8/24/2012 19:05:59	Twitter Web Client	I am proud of the Tea Party. These great patriots have accomplished so much in strengthening our country in only 3 short years.
8/24/2012 18:54:53	Twitter Web Client	.@BarackObama is bankrupting this country. His budget adds another $4.4T to the debt, putting us over $20T in total debt by 2016.
8/24/2012 16:53:43	Twitter Web Client	Terrible tragedy at the Empire State Building today. Must have fast trials and death penalty for the animals.
8/24/2012 14:40:19	Twitter Web Client	.@lancearmstrong should immediately reconsider or his legacy is ruined.
8/24/2012 14:40:03	Twitter Web Client	I am very surprised that @lancearmstrong gave up. I never thought he was a quitter...
8/24/2012 14:09:25	Twitter Web Client	Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood President is visiting us next month. @BarackObama is so excited.
8/24/2012 14:07:39	Twitter Web Client	The Muslim brotherhood is sending tanks into the Sinai &amp; saying it doesn't violate Camp David accord.
8/24/2012 13:29:48	Twitter Web Client	When your life flashes before your eyes, make sure you've got plenty to watch. --Anonymous
8/24/2012 12:55:07	Twitter Web Client	A hurricane will be coming to Tampa. My @RNC convention surprise hits Monday night!
8/23/2012 20:52:00	Twitter Web Client	The independent watchdog who exonerated @BarackObama for the failed green energy loans just donated $52,500 to Obama's campaign.
8/23/2012 19:26:02	Twitter Web Client	@ArsenioOFFICIAL You have already made plenty because of me. How about a 50/50 cut(just joking) see you soon!
8/23/2012 19:22:35	Twitter Web Client	...Spread shots out over long period and watch positive result.

8/16/2012 18:18:36	Twitter Web Client	What's more dangerous for the country--the Iranian nuclear threat or @BarackObama as President?
8/16/2012 17:51:47	Twitter Web Client	The Huffington Post is such a loser--it will die just as AOL is dying, What a stupid deal AOL made to buy it!
8/16/2012 15:14:11	Twitter Web Client	Military reps have attacked @BarackObama over Bin Laden leaks--they believe he's just using this for his benefit. Not a big surprise...

8/15/2012 18:12:31	Twitter Web Client	While @JoeBIden is a gaffe machine, yesterday's comments that @MittRomney will "put y'all back in chains" was not at all proper.
8/15/2012 14:09:29	Twitter Web Client	Nobody wants wind turbines, they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy--a disaster for taxpayers.
8/15/2012 14:07:56	Twitter Web Client	.@BarackObama is promoting ugly, inefficient, unreliable, bird-killing, noisy, neighborhood-destroying wind turbines. Big mistake.
8/14/2012 20:19:16	Twitter Web Client	The Euro is going to collapse soon. Cross border lending is already down and banks are stopping their Euro investments.

8/8/2012 15:17:22	Twitter Web Client	.@HuffingtonPost is doing very badly. Also, very inaccurate stories. Like AOL, when will they fail?
8/8/2012 14:51:49	Twitter Web Client	People are finally beginning to hit China and OPEC. They never give me credit for being the first--by far--but that's okay!
8/8/2012 13:59:08	Twitter Web Client	Looking forward to meeting the great folks of Sarasota GOP party when I am honored as 'Statesman of the Year.' Should be a wonderful time.

8/7/2012 14:05:21	Twitter Web Client	The Fed should not do another 'stimulus.' We can't keep spending our children's future away on waste.
8/6/2012 20:48:24	Twitter Web Client	.@MittRomney will create 2 million new jobs if elected POTUS.  If reelected, @BarackObama will create over $12T in new debt. Easy choice.

6/11/2012 16:27:10	Twitter Web Client	.@MannyPacquiao was robbed in his title fight on Saturday night. No wonder boxing is dying. Bring back the 15 round fights.
6/9/2012 22:38:36	Twitter Web Client	Miss Florida was great in her denial of Miss Pennsylvania's phoney statements. She blows Miss Pennsylvania away- a different league .

6/8/2012 20:35:03	Twitter Web Client	Typical--@BarackObama's Press Secretary deflects any criticism of Obama's constant celebrity visits by attacking me. My great honor.
6/8/2012 19:40:33	Twitter Web Client	This is a tragedy. The real unemployment rate is 14.8% with over 23.2 million unemployed Americans. We can do much better.

6/7/2012 18:12:10	Twitter Web Client	Greece's financial calamity should serve as a warning. @BarackObama's massive deficit spending is unsustainable.

6/6/2012 17:31:46	Twitter Web Client	Why is @BarackObama spending millions to try and hide his records? He is the least transparent President--ever--and he ran on transparency.

6/1/2012 18:21:12	Twitter Web Client	Over $1T in annual deficit spending and adding over $6T to the debt for what? May jobless numbers are horrendous. The great Obama recovery.
6/1/2012 16:06:09	Twitter Web Client	Bay Bridge in California made in China for $1.8 billion. $300 million in cost overruns. Are we stupid?

5/30/2012 20:29:30	Twitter Web Client	It was an honor to be with @MittRomney the night he clinched the nomination. He will defeat @BarackObama and be a tremendous POTUS.
5/30/2012 20:17:27	Twitter Web Client	How ironic that @BarackObama's campaign would call me a charlatan. Have they looked at their boss's record?
5/30/2012 20:10:00	Twitter Web Client	The @MittRomney fundraiser last night was a tremendous success.
5/30/2012 17:22:45	Twitter Web Client	Rush is right. @limbaugh and I have both created more jobs than @BarackObama...in fact, far more jobs!
5/30/2012 16:44:03	Twitter Web Client	I want to see @BarackObama's college records to see how he listed his place of birth in the application.
5/30/2012 16:03:56	Twitter Web Client	Reverend Wright was dumped like a dog by @BarackObama--he can't be feeling too good.
5/30/2012 15:49:12	Twitter Web Client	Perhaps @BarackObama's biggest shortcoming as President is he failed to unite the country.
5/30/2012 15:31:04	Twitter Web Client	Pres @BarackObama expects @MittRomney to play nice like @SenJohnMcCain--it's not going to happen &amp; the result is going to be much different.

5/29/2012 17:40:23	Twitter Web Client	I am very excited about hosting @MittRomney today for a fundraiser. Looking forward to seeing @newtgingrich and many other friends.
5/29/2012 15:48:13	Twitter Web Client	Losers such as George Will and @Rosie use me to get publicity for themselves. They are strictly third rate.
5/27/2012 23:02:39	Twitter Web Client	George Will may be the dumbest(and most overrated) political commentator of all time. If the Republicans listen to him, they will lose.
5/24/2012 20:11:45	Twitter Web Client	Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference. -- Winston Churchill
5/24/2012 18:53:54	Twitter Web Client	Egypt is going the exact opposite of what it was. They will soon be very strongly against Israel. Thanks, President Obama. @BarackObama

5/22/2012 19:41:12	Twitter Web Client	China is now given preference to buy US debt by going directly to Treasury. I don't believe @BarackObama knows that he selling us out.
5/22/2012 19:31:00	Twitter Web Client	Glad to see that Sacha Baron Cohen's new movie is not only a dud but not too good at the box office. He is talentless. @Sacha_B_Cohen

5/22/2012 14:45:25	Twitter Web Client	Rev. Wright called @BarackObama, on tape, a liar. Why isn't this being looked into? It would be a great commercial for the republicans.
5/22/2012 14:11:04	Twitter Web Client	Mr. Pesident, @BarackObama, you cannot attack free enterprise and expect to have a healthy economy!
5/21/2012 19:12:00	Twitter Web Client	America has lost its AAA rating and gained over $6T in debt under @BarackObama and now he wants to raise the debt ceiling--SCARY!
5/21/2012 18:27:44	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @DavidWright of the #Mets. What a great season he is having--batting over 400 and clutch hitting. Also, a fantastic guy.
5/21/2012 17:37:02	Twitter Web Client	The @Yankees must re-negotiate @AROD's contract. He is not the same player without drugs.
5/18/2012 20:41:15	Twitter Web Client	Time Warner Cable went out on 5th Avenue for 2 plus days. They are a disaster. I think I'm going to switch.
5/18/2012 16:21:49	Twitter Web Client	Seems hard to believe that @Facebook could be worth that much--be careful if you invest. And Mark Zuckerberg--get a pre-nup.

5/17/2012 18:54:29	Twitter Web Client	Under Mayor @MikeBloomberg and Police Commissioner @Ray Kelly all violent crime in NYC is down dramatically. That's leadership.

5/17/2012 17:41:37	Twitter Web Client	WaPo attack on alleged high school incidents by @MittRomney is a hit job to me. Where are @BarackObama's high school and college records?

5/16/2012 17:20:52	Twitter Web Client	Glad to see that Jamie Dimon passed yesterday's shareholder vote. The JP Morgan stock holders understand that a good CEO is worth keeping.
5/15/2012 20:28:01	Twitter Web Client	We should not bail out any of the European countries or banks.
5/15/2012 19:00:17	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to my friend @limbaugh on being named to the "Hall of Famous Missourians." Rush is a great guy &amp; a great character.

5/14/2012 14:13:50	Twitter Web Client	The TIME Magazine cover showing late age breast feeding is disgusting--sad what TIME did to get noticed. @TIME

5/11/2012 19:57:56	Twitter Web Client	@AndyPettitte ratted out his best friend @RogerClemens in a ridiculous trial. Not nice! Who is rooting for Andy P?
5/11/2012 19:40:06	Twitter Web Client	Ugly industrial wind turbines are ruining the beauty of parts of the country--and have inefficient unreliable energy to boot.
5/11/2012 19:32:45	Twitter Web Client	Terrible. Wind farms are provided permits by the US government, which causes the "programmatic" killing of bald eagles.
5/11/2012 18:46:58	Twitter Web Client	If the press can report stories from @MittRomney's dorm years then why can't it find @BarackObama's college and law school transcripts?
5/11/2012 18:30:51	Twitter Web Client	Procter and Gamble is relocating its beauty headquarters from Cincinnati to Asia--what are we doing?!

5/10/2012 18:14:23	Twitter Web Client	Who's the flip flopper? @MittRomney has never flip flopped on gay marriage.
5/10/2012 15:34:41	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @IsraeliPM @netanyahu on forming his new unity government. A major political success for the Jewish State of Israel.
5/10/2012 15:10:23	Twitter Web Client	.@Cher attacked @MittRomney. She is an average talent who is out of touch with reality. Like @Rosie O'Donnell, a total loser!
5/9/2012 20:08:26	Twitter Web Client	The polling numbers show a close race. @MittRomney needs all of our support.
5/9/2012 19:36:59	Twitter Web Client	Georgetown should not host @KathleenSebelius for the graduation ceremony. Her policies abuse Catholics.
5/9/2012 19:15:51	Twitter Web Client	Gas prices are still too high. We really need to pressure OPEC to lower the price of oil.
5/9/2012 13:53:14	Twitter Web Client	It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.  Some good words from Albert Einstein. It pays to be tenacious.

5/8/2012 19:02:40	Twitter Web Client	You can't build a reputation on what you're doing to do.  Great quote by Henry Ford.
5/7/2012 20:04:58	Twitter Web Client	We must keep the pressure on @BarackObama's administration to make sure Chen comes to the US. It would be a tragedy to abandon him in China.
5/7/2012 19:28:34	Twitter Web Client	Our economy is at a standstill. Some are even predicting a possible double dip. We need to elect @MittRomney in November.
5/7/2012 18:56:33	Twitter Web Client	The election result in France is very disappointing. The Europeans have to embrace austerity in order for their economy to fully recover.
5/7/2012 18:24:07	Twitter Web Client	The 9/11 trials at Gitmo over the weekend were a disaster. Can you imagine how much worse it would be if @BarackObama tried them in NYC?
5/7/2012 15:39:55	Twitter Web Client	Much as it pays to emphasize the positive, there are times when the only choice is confrontation. #TheArtofTheDeal
5/1/2012 19:05:02	Twitter Web Client	America's debt crisis is our country's greatest challenge. Spending must be curbed for our long term fiscal future.

4/30/2012 18:03:28	Twitter Web Client	Barack Obama's delivery on Saturday night was excellent--cute mention of Trump--and I am flattered to be mentioned. @BarackObama
4/30/2012 16:57:15	Twitter Web Client	Good Morning America is thrilled @Rosie is working for the @todayshow--that means almost guaranteed success for @GMA
4/30/2012 16:38:35	Twitter Web Client	He @johnedwards is bad, but @andrewyoung is worse--not only is he a "rat" but it turns out he stole much of the money for himself.
4/30/2012 16:01:02	Twitter Web Client	Rosie O'Donnell should leave Lindsay Lohan alone--@Rosie has bigger problems than Lindsay. Lindsay's mother called my office for help
4/30/2012 14:50:42	Twitter Web Client	Tomorrow is #TrumpTuesday on @squawkCNBC 7:30 AM EST. Always interesting.
4/24/2012 12:54:08	Twitter Web Client	I am enjoying my travels across Europe but home is where the heart is. Looking forward to coming back to the family in New York very soon.

4/19/2012 23:07:01	Twitter Web Client	Dick Clark was a friend of mine, he lived in one of my buildings on East 61st Street. Everybody loved him. He will be missed.
4/19/2012 19:02:18	Twitter Web Client	Ted Nugent was obviously using a figure of speech, unfortunate as it was. It just shows the anger people have towards @BarackObama.
4/19/2012 16:50:30	Twitter Web Client	@MittRomney has shown last week that he will campaign aggressively against @BarackObama. I am confident he can defeat @BarackObama.
4/16/2012 14:17:03	Twitter Web Client	Mike Bloomberg is doing a great job as Mayor of New York City. Ray Kelly is a great Police Commissioner. @MikeBloomberg

4/14/2012 19:52:01	Twitter Web Client	The FDA must immediately stop allowing massive dose vaccinations in babies. It is mind boggling that they allow this practice to continue.
4/14/2012 19:06:34	Twitter Web Client	Axl Rose should take his #rockhall2012 honors and be happy. Stop the no induction nonsense. Do it for your fans @axlrose.

4/11/2012 18:18:21	Twitter Web Client	He @MittRomney is a successful entrepreneur. @BarackObama successfuly ruined America's credit. Easy choice in November.
4/11/2012 18:15:05	Twitter Web Client	There can never be a sharp economic recovery until @BarackObama is out of the White House.
4/11/2012 18:10:28	Twitter Web Client	The Fed should not do QE3. Neither the economy nor the dollar can withstand another round of artificial liquidity.
4/10/2012 20:00:22	Twitter Web Client	Good news--@RickSantorum did the right thing. I congratulate him on running a very good race. Now it's onto @BarackObama -- go get him Mitt!

4/6/2012 17:23:56	Twitter Web Client	THe WH should not have hosted the Muslim Brotherhood. @BarackObama's friends are enemies of the US and @Israel. The Islamist winter is here.
4/6/2012 15:44:52	Twitter Web Client	Looked at plans for Trump Doral Country Club today. It will be amazing! Glad to be in Miami.
4/6/2012 15:43:49	Twitter Web Client	Proud to see my friend Governor Chris Christie standing up for Israel on his visit. Standing tall!
4/6/2012 15:41:52	Twitter Web Client	Arrived in Palm Beach, drove by a gas staion, $4.50 a gallon. Result of failed @BarackObama leadership.
4/6/2012 14:16:56	Twitter Web Client	Don't miss me on @foxandfriends Monday at 7:30 AM
4/5/2012 18:29:21	Twitter Web Client	While @BarackObama criticizes the GOP budget, his own party graded him with an "F" by voting down his budget in the House 414-0.
4/5/2012 17:32:00	TwitLonger Beta	Oprah will end up doing just fine with her network--she knows how to win. @Oprah

4/4/2012 16:14:09	Twitter Web Client	My twitter account is now reaching more people than the New York Times--not bad. And we're only going to get better!
4/2/2012 17:21:50	Twitter Web Client	What will be @RickSantorum's excuse tomorrow after @MittRomney wins Wisconsin and Maryland? Time for Rick to face reality and drop out.
3/30/2012 19:23:56	Twitter Web Client	I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM.
3/29/2012 18:19:58	Twitter Web Client	@marcorubio's endorsement of @MittRomney shows that the GOP is coalescing to defeat @BarackObama.
3/28/2012 20:26:27	Twitter Web Client	I wonder if @BarackObama has promised Iran and China that he can be more flexible after his last election?
3/28/2012 16:47:26	TwitLonger Beta	I'll be interviewed by Greta Van Susteren @Gretawire tonight at 10 pm ET on Fox.
3/28/2012 16:03:52	TwitLonger Beta	@jayleno - my description of @MittRomney - "Future President" or "POTUS 45" or "@BarackObama's Worst Nightmare"
3/26/2012 19:30:42	Twitter Web Client	ObamaCare is clearly unconstitutional. Hopefully the USC rules correctly but in the end repealing ObamaCare requires a political solution.
3/26/2012 18:10:45	Twitter Web Client	Whether @RepPaulRyan's plan is sound fiscal policy is not the relevant issue, the issue is strategic timing. Why release it now?
3/26/2012 15:47:24	TwitLonger Beta	Trump Tuesday: I'll be on @SquawkCNBC tomorrow morning at 7:30 AM. Be sure to tune in.
3/23/2012 14:29:46	Twitter Web Client	I'll be on @Foxandfriends Monday at 7:30 AM.
3/22/2012 17:57:06	TwitLonger Beta	Happy Birthday to my legendary friend Aretha Franklin.
3/20/2012 18:53:36	Twitter Web Client	Played the Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach last weekend. One of the best golf courses in the country. Perfect weather.
3/20/2012 18:01:05	Twitter Web Client	He @RickSantorum wants to decide what books people can read, what movies they can see. #freespeech  It doesn't work that way!
3/20/2012 17:45:05	Twitter Web Client	Trump Tuesday on @SquawkCNBC, 7:30 AM, is getting very good ratings as is @Foxandfriends on Mondays, 7:30 AM.
3/20/2012 17:29:13	Twitter Web Client	@MittRomney should consider Gov McDonnell of VA, Gov Christie of NJ and Senator Rubio of FL for VP. Really good men doing a really good job.
3/20/2012 15:50:40	Twitter Web Client	Just bought Doral Hotel &amp; Country Club in Miami--within two years it will be the best resort in the country.
3/20/2012 15:14:40	Twitter Web Client	I am deeply disturbed by what I have read in the case of @TrayvonMartin. I support a full investigation and justice.
3/20/2012 14:54:36	Twitter Web Client	I am so glad @Rosie got fired by @Oprah. Rosie is a bully and it's always nice to see bullies go down!
3/19/2012 20:30:53	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @BarackObama for being reckless. In his first 38 months in office the debt has grown at a rate that is unthinkable.
3/19/2012 18:39:59	Twitter Web Client	Why does @BarackObama always have to rely on teleprompters?
3/19/2012 16:03:48	Twitter Web Client	Give great credit to @GeorgeClooney for exposing the atrocities taking place in Sudan.
3/16/2012 19:28:58	Twitter Web Client	We should have gotten more of the oil in Syria, and we should have gotten more of the oil in Iraq. Dumb leaders.
3/16/2012 17:18:10	Twitter Web Client	@BarackObama has wasted billions of our tax dollars on speculative green projects like Solyndra. He is an economic ignoramus.
3/16/2012 17:13:57	Twitter Web Client	Rising gas prices are causing a steep rise in consumer prices and will slow any future economic growth. It is a tax on all Americans.
3/16/2012 15:47:00	Twitter Web Client	I'll be on @foxandfriends Monday at 7:30 AM.  Be sure to tune in.
3/14/2012 18:59:36	TwitLonger Beta	I commend @DrZuhdiJasser for defending the NYPD and Commissioner Kelly. The NYPD has done outstanding work in defending NYC from attacks.
3/14/2012 18:22:19	TwitLonger Beta	@NicolletteSheridan lost a big motion yesterday--she is entitled to nothing. The show made her--she should have been happy.
3/13/2012 20:36:30	Twitter Web Client	@MittRomney has won the most delegates, received the most votes and won the most states. The primary is over. Time to defeat @BarackObama.
3/13/2012 17:16:47	Twitter Web Client	He @RickSantorum should get out of the race so Republicans can focus on @BarackObama.
3/13/2012 17:10:33	Twitter Web Client	Cadillac Championship at Doral a great success--I just bought Doral--it will be amazing. Cadillac a great American car.
3/13/2012 17:08:39	Twitter Web Client	His @BarackObama's specialties? Vacations and campaigning. Jobs not so much!
3/12/2012 18:34:24	Twitter Web Client	Doral Tournament was great--best 18th hole in golf and a wonderful winner in @JustinRose
3/12/2012 18:17:57	Twitter Web Client	Afghanistan is a total disaster. We don't know what we are doing. They are, in addition to everything else, robbing us blind.
3/12/2012 17:46:27	Twitter Web Client	Maniac Sergeant who went on a killing spree in Afghanistan must be punished, big time, and quickly.
3/12/2012 15:39:42	TwitLonger Beta	Seems to be the next election must be about jobs and gas prices--not birth control.
3/12/2012 15:34:12	TwitLonger Beta	When I was 18, people called me Donald Trump. When he was 18, @BarackObama was Barry Soweto. Weird.
3/12/2012 15:31:18	TwitLonger Beta	Personally, I'm glad the NYPD is monitoring the actions of certain extremists. New York's finest! I support them.
3/9/2012 17:19:01	Twitter Web Client	I'll be on @foxandfriends Monday at 7:30 AM, don't miss it.
3/9/2012 14:11:02	Twitter Web Client	The only candidate who can get 1145 delegates is @MittRomney. The primary is over.
3/9/2012 13:59:28	Twitter Web Client	BarackObama set a record deficit last February - $229 billion while borrowing 42 cents of every dollar it spent. @BarackObama is reckless.
3/8/2012 21:28:05	Twitter Web Client	Excited by my acquisition of Doral Hotel & Country Club in Miami--already world class, but will soon be The Best.
3/8/2012 21:25:20	Twitter Web Client	Ray Kelly is the best Police Commissioner in NYC history. Keeping NYC safe thru vigilance. @RayKelly
3/7/2012 18:10:11	Twitter Web Client	Happy and proud to help @MittRomney win Ohio with robo-calls in pivotal Cuyahoga County
3/6/2012 20:07:15	Twitter Web Client	Someone should ask @BarackObama in today's press conference how he accumulated more debt in 3 years than the first 42 presidents combined.
3/6/2012 17:20:39	Twitter Web Client	Today will be a Super Tuesday for @MittRomney -- he will win over 220 delegates from states across every region. He will be the nominee.
3/5/2012 21:05:13	Twitter Web Client	I fully support the @NYPD, @MayorBloomberg and @CommissionerKelly. They should all be honored for protecting us since 9/11---not demonized.
3/1/2012 19:26:46	Twitter Web Client	He made a great contribution to the press--@AndrewBreitbart will be missed.
2/29/2012 20:18:34	Twitter Web Client	@BarackObama should stop pressuring Israel against attacking Iran and worry how he will stop the Iranian nuclear drive. @BarackObama
2/29/2012 17:36:48	Twitter Web Client	After Super Tuesday, every GOP candidate should take a long hard look at their prospects and drop out if they can't get the nomination.
2/29/2012 17:27:09	Twitter Web Client	I loved being a surrogate on behalf of @MittRomney. I am glad I was able to help him win.
2/28/2012 17:06:27	Twitter Web Client	America will have record growth and prosperity during his adminstration: @MittRomney's success in the private sector is a tremendous asset.
2/28/2012 16:42:21	Twitter Web Client	The oil reserve is a strageic asset for a time of war and an embargo. @BarackObama should open more land for drilling, not tap the reserve.
2/28/2012 16:06:05	Twitter Web Client	Mitt's got it right: @RickSantorum's attacks on @MittRomney's pro-growth tax cut proposal are foolish.
2/27/2012 20:07:43	Twitter Web Client	It is time Republicans stop attacking each other and focus on @BarackObama. America cannot survive a second term.
2/27/2012 19:34:27	Twitter Web Client	It is time to get out of Afghanistan. We are building roads and schools for people that hate us. It is not in our national interests.
2/27/2012 16:57:45	Twitter Web Client	What America needs: @MittRomney follows in steps of Kemp and Reagan with pro-growth tax cut.
2/24/2012 17:01:34	Twitter Web Client	I'm on @foxandfriends every Monday morning at 7:30...
2/24/2012 13:55:06	Twitter Web Client	Clive Davis gave a great eulogy at my friend Whitney Houston's funeral--absolutely amazing!
2/24/2012 13:49:32	Twitter Web Client	Debbie Wasserman Schultz is hard to watch or listen to--no wonder our country is going to hell!
2/23/2012 17:35:48	Twitter Web Client	In last night's #CNNDebate @MittRomney proved once again why he is the steady conservative who can restore America's future.
2/22/2012 17:35:31	TwitLonger Beta	@CelebApprentice is having wonderful ratings once again. @IvankaTrump & @DonaldJTrumpJr. I am very proud of this season.
2/22/2012 15:05:15	TwitLonger Beta	The more I get to know @MittRomney the more I like him. He has the judgment and private sector experience America needs in the White House.
2/21/2012 20:05:14	TwitLonger Beta	If the GOP will have any chance to beat @BarackObama in November, the great people of Michigan need to support @MittRomney's candidacy.
2/17/2012 21:18:15	Twitter Web Client	Watch #CelebApprentice this Sunday at 9PM ESTon @NBC--it has received many 4 star reviews.
2/17/2012 20:46:28	Twitter Web Client	Our ally Canada wants to send their oil down south to us. @BarackObama is forcing Canada to send it west to China.
2/17/2012 17:51:54	Twitter Web Client	Don't forget! Sunday night at 9 pm EST on @nbc--Celebrity Apprentice is back! Tune in for a great show. @ApprenticeNBC
2/16/2012 21:01:35	Twitter Web Client	The Fed is considering issuing even more US bond debt into the market. Not good!
2/16/2012 16:47:34	Twitter Web Client	Old Post Office Building in DC will be a world-class Trump property. Honored to be doing this historic building--Washington will be proud.
2/16/2012 16:04:34	Twitter Web Client	He @MittRomney gets the China problem, why don't the others?
2/16/2012 15:38:28	Twitter Web Client	Very successful fund raising for @MittRomney yesterday. Good to see my friend Woody Johnson.
2/16/2012 14:21:43	Twitter Web Client	@MemoInc  You have to find a business that you love. That's number one. Success requires passion. Then keep your focus and never give up.
2/15/2012 21:09:18	Twitter Web Client	The recession was made worse by @BarackObama. A $900Billion deficit is not getting better.
2/15/2012 20:48:56	Twitter Web Client	When the economy is bad, @BarackObama wants to raise taxes. When the economy is good, @BarackObama wants to raise taxes. Notice a trend?
2/15/2012 20:46:17	Twitter Web Client	Iran's attack on Israeli diplomats is an attack on the West
2/15/2012 20:31:21	Twitter Web Client	RT: @thedailybeast: Polling shows the @AmericansElect movement could still nominate a viable independent with a chance of victory...
2/15/2012 20:12:10	Twitter Web Client	@kingdelrosario I like to invest in what I know, which tends to be real estate, but I keep an open mind.
2/15/2012 20:10:45	Twitter Web Client	@atlthrasher  I don't think it has run its course. There are opportunities. Finding them and maximizing them are key components for success.
2/15/2012 20:03:32	Twitter Web Client	@HangersMensLine  My agenda is such that I can't meet with you, but it's always nice to be asked and I wish you the best.
2/15/2012 19:57:30	Twitter Web Client	@The_Joey  That could be a possibility but there are no plans at the moment. This season of Celebrity Apprentice is great--be sure to watch.
2/15/2012 18:44:32	Twitter Web Client	Flattering. Over 500 upset people called Mar-a-Lago disappointed I am not running for President--but Mitt Romney will do a great job.
2/14/2012 18:24:30	Twitter Web Client	So wrong! @BarackObama is hosting China's VP Xi Jinping today at the Pentagon with a full honor ceremony with music and cannons...
2/14/2012 18:21:21	Twitter Web Client	A day after @BarackObama released a trillion dollar budget deficit, he is hosting China's future leader VP XiJinping. America's new reality.
2/14/2012 16:29:43	Twitter Web Client	A day after Greece burned @BarackObama released a $3.8 Trillion budget for 2013 with a $900 Billion deficit.He will turn America into Greece
2/14/2012 14:29:32	Twitter Web Client	Watch Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on NBC at 12:35 EST tonight---I'll be bringing a couple of surprises with me.
2/13/2012 17:44:35	Twitter Web Client	Honored to have passed 1 million twitter followers. We are making America #1 again. #TimeToGetTough
2/13/2012 16:05:49	Twitter Web Client	Whitney Houston was a great friend and an amazing talent. We will all miss her and send our prayers to her family.
2/10/2012 22:08:17	Twitter Web Client	This week we saw what Obama Care actually does when implemented.  It is a losing issue for @BarackObama and must be repealed.
2/10/2012 22:06:52	Twitter Web Client	@BarackObama’s class warfare rhetoric is taking a backseat for the DNC convention.  He is charging $1 Million for a single suite.
2/10/2012 21:43:47	Twitter Web Client	The $25 Billion settlement with the banks on mortgages will slow the housing market down even more and create higher user fees. Stupid!
2/10/2012 20:12:11	Twitter Web Client	@MittRomney will give a great speech at CPAC today. He understands the threat from China.
2/9/2012 16:02:53	Twitter Web Client	@Misterglorious  I wear suits from the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection.
2/9/2012 0:33:14	Twitter Web Client	Jon Huntsman called to see me. I said no, he gave away our country to China! @JonHuntsman
2/8/2012 20:09:22	Twitter Web Client	ObamaCare is an attack on our country's identity. The latest victim is the Catholic church. It must be full repealed. @BarackObama
2/8/2012 20:01:59	Twitter Web Client	@fatmaninaspeedo  I have not met @MacMiller but his song, Donald Trump, has had over 40 milion hits. Maybe he should pay me somethiing.
2/8/2012 19:39:27	Twitter Web Client	@GrimeyGatsby  I only require four hours of sleep per night.
2/8/2012 19:16:54	Twitter Web Client	Glad to see no charges against Greg Kelly. His accusers' charges never made sense!
2/8/2012 19:11:03	Twitter Web Client	I see my friend @FlaGovScott is speaking at CPAC. Solid guy, wonderful job. #sayfie @marcaputo
2/8/2012 19:07:22	Twitter Web Client	@Miss_Drax  My first job was working for and with my father, Fred C. Trump.
2/8/2012 19:03:12	Twitter Web Client	@IanBQueen  In answer to your question, my favorite thing to do is spending time with my family.
2/8/2012 18:34:26	Twitter Web Client	Eli Manning. Great Athlete. Great Guy. @NYGiants great teamwork!
2/8/2012 18:25:41	Twitter Web Client	Why is @MittRomney the only guy who talks about getting tough with China and their currency manipulation?
2/8/2012 16:03:46	Twitter Web Client	Many people have been asking me to answer questions. You can ask me questions at any time. #TrumpQandA
2/7/2012 21:27:19	Twitter Web Client	I see @FLGovScott poll numbers are improving. Good man doing a good job.
2/7/2012 21:00:44	Twitter Web Client	Many, many people are disappointed I didn't run third party--but I won't risk @BarackObama benefiting from a split in the anti-Obama vote.
2/7/2012 20:23:09	Twitter Web Client	I endorsed @MittRomney not because I agree with him on every issue but because he will get tough with China.
2/6/2012 20:23:55	Twitter Web Client	The Prayer Breakfast was used by @BarackObama to say that the Bible commands higher income taxes. That's not the way it is!
2/3/2012 15:48:51	Twitter Web Client	Sleepy eyed @chucktodd thinks Las Vegas is a state--see @todayshow this morning.
2/1/2012 14:58:52	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @MittRomney for an impressive win in Florida. He performed well under pressure.
1/31/2012 20:02:14	Twitter Web Client	The banks need to start lending again otherwise the economy will continue its downturn. This is why we bailed the banks out!
1/27/2012 18:29:02	Twitter Web Client	Watch the clip from my #C21 Super Bowl spot on @AccessHollywood tonight.
1/25/2012 19:01:59	Twitter Web Client	Tom Brokaw keeps calling Mitt Romney "George" (Mitt's father). Sadly, time is up for Tom.
1/25/2012 16:44:02	Twitter Web Client	All I heard in the SOTU was proposals for more govt, more spending and more bureaucrats. Very bad!
1/24/2012 20:27:51	Twitter Web Client	It is a shame Keystone wasn't powered by solar panels and wind because then @BarackObama would have wasted billions on it.
1/24/2012 20:04:40	Twitter Web Client	A gallon of gas has more than doubled while @BarackObama has been POTUS and he still won't approve Keystone.
1/24/2012 19:47:28	Twitter Web Client	It has been 1,000 days since @BarackObama has passed a budget. He continues to spend this country into the ground without any control.
1/24/2012 19:26:05	Twitter Web Client	Tonight in his SOTU, @BarackObama won't talk about Keystone. He will continue to dissemble about his record and play class warfare.
1/23/2012 20:03:59	Twitter Web Client	Iran is threatening to shut the Strait of Hormuz and @BarackObama won't approve the Keystone pipeline. His energy policy makes America weak.
1/23/2012 19:03:23	Twitter Web Client	A tough week was had by@MittRomney, but he's come back from adversity before.
1/23/2012 15:47:37	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @newtgingrich on a stunning win in South Carolina. All eyes are on Florida now.
1/20/2012 19:32:17	Twitter Web Client	Canada will now sell its oil to China because @BarackObama rejected Keystone. At least China knows a good deal when they see it.
1/20/2012 18:32:24	Twitter Web Client	The White House should stop publicly pressuring Israel on Iran. Iran's nuclear program is the threat, not Israel's right to self-defense.
1/20/2012 17:07:55	Twitter Web Client	The law requires individuals pay 15% on carried interest. Why would a potential President pay more than he or she is supposed to?
1/19/2012 21:01:38	Twitter Web Client	The national debt continues to rise at record levels and today @BarackObama is in Disney World. He lives in a fantasy.
1/19/2012 20:44:42	Twitter Web Client	When will @BarackObama release his transcripts? What is he hiding?
1/19/2012 20:32:17	Twitter Web Client	Playing politics with the Keystone decision? @BarackObama vetos 20,000 jobs and cheaper oil.
1/19/2012 20:13:43	Twitter Web Client	Texas is lucky to have him--- @GovernorPerry is a great guy!
1/19/2012 19:37:08	Twitter Web Client	Rick Perry--a good man, a great family and a patriot.
1/18/2012 22:13:29	Twitter Web Client	Listen to my interview with @gretawire tonight at 10PM ET on @FoxNews.
1/13/2012 20:14:47	Twitter Web Client	While @BarackObama is slashing the military, he is also negotiating with our sworn enemy the Taliban--who facilitated 9/11.
1/9/2012 18:41:08	Twitter Web Client	Sadly, when it comes to using the energy industry to create American jobs, Obama has been a total disaster.  #TimeToGetTough
1/9/2012 15:32:55	Twitter Web Client	Be sure to watch my interview on @Gretawire tonight!
1/6/2012 19:35:38	Twitter Web Client	Getting China to stop playing its currency charades can begin whenever we elect a president ready to take decisive action. #TimeToGetTough
1/6/2012 19:01:11	Twitter Web Client	If other countries benefit from our armed forces protecting them, those countries should pay for the protection.  #TimeToGetTough
1/6/2012 17:37:38	Twitter Web Client	People who have the ability to work should. But with the government happy to send checks, too many of them don't. #TimeToGetTough
1/5/2012 19:56:22	Twitter Web Client	President @BarackObama's vacation is costing taxpayers millions of dollars----Unbelievable!
1/5/2012 15:47:20	Twitter Web Client	Obama's plan to have Russia stand up to Iran was a horrible failure that turned America into a laughingstock.  #TimeToGetTough
1/4/2012 19:33:08	Twitter Web Client	Nobody cares about the Iowa straw poll is what @JonHuntsman said yesterday. His problem is that nobody cares about his campaign (or him).
1/4/2012 19:03:32	Twitter Web Client	Michele Bachmann just dropped out of prez race--- when she didn't do the Newsmax debate it showed great disloyalty and people rejected her.
1/4/2012 18:53:29	Twitter Web Client	We left Iraq and it is quickly falling apart--what a waste of lives and money--and so obvious.
1/4/2012 17:57:39	Twitter Web Client	Under President @BarackObama, China has experienced unusually fast gains and America unusually fast losses. #TimeToGetTough
1/4/2012 17:48:54	Twitter Web Client	He should be ignored: @RonPaul's foreign policy is a dream come true for our enemies. He has zero chance to beat @BarackObama.
1/4/2012 17:42:41	Twitter Web Client	Michele Bachmann got less than 1,200 more votes in the Caucus than she did in the Ames Straw Poll. Very sad for her--a nice woman!
1/4/2012 17:37:08	Twitter Web Client	Congratulations to @RickSantorum for coming out of Iowa a winner!
1/3/2012 21:20:25	Twitter Web Client	He knows he won't have to spend much: @JonHuntsman has offered to match any donation dollar for dollar.
1/3/2012 20:33:15	Twitter Web Client	Michele Bachmann will finish dead last tonight in Iowa because she is disloyal and a terrible boss. Sadly, it is over for Michele.
1/3/2012 20:07:41	Twitter Web Client	To have a government we can afford we need to eliminate the tremendous waste clogging the system #TimeToGetTough
1/3/2012 19:51:54	Twitter Web Client	The Wall Street Journal has reported that Obama's food stamp policies are ushering in a massive 'food stamp crime wave.' #TimeToGet Tough
1/3/2012 19:32:41	Twitter Web Client	The Democrats' solution is the same solution they have for everything--tax, tax, tax. Just one problem: it doesn't work  #TimeToGetTough
1/3/2012 19:25:16	Twitter Web Client	I will be on the @todayshow tomorrow morning to make a major announcement about a television show. Stay tuned!
12/30/2011 19:03:30	Twitter Web Client	The Washington Establishment will never rein in government spending, waste, fraud and abuse. A great thinker and outsider is needed.
12/30/2011 18:47:42	Twitter Web Client	When will the US government finally classify China as a currency manipulator? China is robbing us blind and @BarackObama defends them.
12/30/2011 18:12:30	Twitter Web Client	I play golf to relax. My company is in great shape. @BarackObama plays golf to escape work while America goes down the drain.
12/30/2011 17:57:29	Twitter Web Client	NYC should hold a parade for returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.
12/29/2011 20:44:06	Twitter Web Client	I like Russell Brand, but Katy Perry made a big mistake when she married him. Let's see if I'm right---I hope not.
12/29/2011 20:26:00	Twitter Web Client	America wasted billions and precious lives in Iraq and Iran will soon take control--very very sad.
12/29/2011 16:49:20	Twitter Web Client	I predicted the 9/11 attack on America in my book "The America We Deserve" and the collapse of Iraq in @TimeToGetTough.
12/29/2011 16:32:58	Twitter Web Client	Americans Elect on track to put an Indy Presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states.
12/28/2011 19:11:33	Twitter Web Client	It's important that we help poor people to become independent, self-sufficient individuals who gain the benefits of work. #TimeToGetTough
12/28/2011 16:27:35	Twitter Web Client	The Fed's reckless monetary policies will cause problems in the years to come. The Fed has to be reined in or we will soon be Greece.
12/28/2011 14:51:24	TwitLonger Beta	@TrumpCollection tops @TravlandLeisure 500 Best Hotels in the World! Congrats @TrumpNewYork, @TrumpLasVegas, @TrumpChicago, @TrumpSoHo
12/27/2011 20:53:02	Twitter Web Client	The Keystone pipeline will create 20,000 jobs and lower gas prices. But Obama says No. Dumb.
12/27/2011 19:38:11	Twitter Web Client	Govt. collapsing in Iraq only 2 weeks after withdrawal of our troops. Sadly, I called this one and please remember, I alone called it.
12/27/2011 19:08:55	Twitter Web Client	The habitual vacationer, @BarackObama, is now in Hawaii. This vacation is costing taxpayers $4 milion +++  while there is 20% unemployment.
12/27/2011 18:45:03	Twitter Web Client	In order to preserve my options and guarantee that @BarackObama is defeated, I changed my voter registration to independent.
12/22/2011 21:25:58	Twitter Web Client	The Keystone pipeline will create 20,000 jobs and make us less energy dependent from the Middle East. @BarackObama says No!
12/22/2011 20:55:19	Twitter Web Client	The safest way to preserve Medicare is with a robust and vibrant economy. We should lower corporate and capital gain taxes immediately.
12/22/2011 19:32:08	Twitter Web Client	My new book #TimeToGetTough is the best present of the holiday season. A great gift for anyone who cares about this country.
12/21/2011 20:36:36	Twitter Web Client	Barney Frank looked disgusting--nipples protruding--in his blue shirt before Congress. Very very disrespectful.
12/21/2011 19:36:04	Twitter Web Client	He is delusional: @BarackObama believes that he is the 4th best POTUS ever.
12/21/2011 18:55:56	Twitter Web Client	Obamacare has to be killed now before it grows into an even bigger mess, as it inevitably will. #TimeToGetTough
12/21/2011 18:49:33	Twitter Web Client	The sad truth is some Republicans in Congress are clueless when it comes to negotiation.  #TimeToGetTough
12/21/2011 18:28:58	Twitter Web Client	I really enjoyed last night's Tele-Town Hall with @ralphreed's Faith and Freedom Coalition. Thanks to the thousands who joined.
12/21/2011 18:20:31	Twitter Web Client	I still can't believe we didn't t take the oil from Iraq.
12/20/2011 20:44:13	Twitter Web Client	Joe Biden said that the Taliban 'is not our enemy.' I wonder how our troops in Afghanistant that are under attack view Biden's statement.
12/20/2011 20:12:46	Twitter Web Client	What a shock! The U.S. Capitol Christmas tree pays homage @BarackObama but failed to mention Jesus.
12/20/2011 19:36:28	Twitter Web Client	He thinks that the wealth you create belongs to the gov't. @BarackObama doesn't respect the fact that the money he wastes belongs to us.
12/20/2011 18:41:50	Twitter Web Client	When are we going to wake up and realize that we are funding our enemies?  #TimeToGetTough
12/20/2011 15:51:21	Twitter Web Client	It's a plain fact: free trade requires having fair rules that apply to everyone.#TimeToGetTough
12/20/2011 15:10:42	Twitter Web Client	We need a tax system that is fair and smart--one that encourages growth, savings, and investment. #TimeToGetTough
12/20/2011 15:04:19	Twitter Web Client	China taxing imports from the US --22%-- why aren't we taxing China?
12/20/2011 14:38:29	Twitter Web Client	Dummies left Iraq without the oil--not believable!
12/20/2011 14:22:57	Twitter Web Client	Iraq in political turmoil one day after we leave---I told you so.
12/19/2011 21:28:23	Twitter Web Client	Barney Frank admited that ObamaCare does have 'death panels' yesterday. Obamacare must be fully repealed or healthcare will be destroyed.
12/19/2011 21:25:24	Twitter Web Client	With a record deficit and $15 trillion in debt, @BarackObama is spending $4 million of our money on his Hawaii vacation. Just plain wrong.
12/16/2011 21:12:15	Twitter Web Client	OPEC is setting crude at $94/barrel on 'signs US economy is improving.' OPEC uses any excuse to rip us off and our leaders just watch.
12/16/2011 20:36:42	Twitter Web Client	China just put a tariff on US cars and trucks--22%--China is laughing at our inept leaders. @BarackObama
12/16/2011 20:18:23	Twitter Web Client	The lightweight, @JonHuntsman, used my name in a debate for gravitas--it didn't work. Sad!
12/16/2011 18:49:07	Twitter Web Client	But maybe my biggest beef with Obama is his view that there's nothing special or exceptional about America. #TimeToGetTough
12/16/2011 18:27:02	Twitter Web Client	I believe this book will rock a lot of people. Don't just read #TImeToGetTough but share it with your friends and family! -RushLimbaugh

12/15/2011 20:06:42	Twitter Web Client	So biased: @TIME made 'The Protester' as the person of the year. @TIME celebrates OWS but vilified the Tea Party last year.
12/15/2011 18:31:42	Twitter Web Client	If speeches and memoirs created jobs then @BarackObama would be Ronald Reagan.
12/15/2011 15:56:16	Twitter Web Client	With the number of tweets sad sack @Rosie has done, she has totally lost control of herself-- hopefully not a breakdown.
12/15/2011 15:55:01	Twitter Web Client	#noratings @Lawrence will soon be off tv- bad ratings- he has a face made for radio.

12/14/2011 22:08:19	TweetDeck	The habitual vacationer, @BarackObama, has sacrificed so much. He is delaying his 17 day Hawaii vacation a couple of hours.
12/14/2011 21:53:48	TweetDeck	Iran is closing the Strait of Hormuz for a military exercise. Imagine what they will do with nukes?!
12/14/2011 21:04:49	TweetDeck	The Mullahs laughed when @BarackObama "asked" Iran to return our drone--they will show it to China first.
12/14/2011 20:48:28	TweetDeck	We have to combat the welfare mentality that says individuals are entitled to live off taxpayers. #TimeToGetTough
12/14/2011 20:07:14	TweetDeck	It has been great to meet so many wonderful people in my #TimeToGetTough book signings. Anyone who wants to be Prez should read!
12/14/2011 19:26:49	TweetDeck	So, if Iran is going to take over the oil, I say we take over the oil first by hammering out a cost-sharing plan with Iraq.#TimeToGetTough
12/14/2011 17:20:55	Twitter Web Client	Save your time @rosie and focus on your horrible ratings, and don't mention my name on talk shows anymore or you will get more of the same.
12/14/2011 17:19:00	Twitter Web Client	#badratings @Rosie you will never make it. You are not funny or talented.
12/14/2011 16:48:15	Twitter Web Client	#badratings @Lawrence's show failed at 8pm and is failing(even worse) at 10pm- not long for tv.....
12/14/2011 16:45:55	TweetDeck	I feel sorry for Rosie 's new partner in love whose parents are devastated at the thought of their daughter being with @Rosie--a true loser.
12/14/2011 15:22:56	TweetDeck	Thousands of e-mails from folks urging me to seek the Americans Elect Presidential nomination.
12/14/2011 15:01:17	TweetDeck	He says he will spend $1 B to get re-elected: @BarackObama. I can match him--preserving my options.
12/14/2011 14:44:03	TweetDeck	I'll be signing copies of my new book @TimeToGetTough tomorrow at Trump Tower (5th Avenue between 56 and 57) from noon to 2pm.
12/13/2011 21:17:19	TweetDeck	Real unemployment is 20%. We must simplify the tax code and start making our own products again to bring our jobs back from overseas.
12/13/2011 20:16:22	TweetDeck	Who handed Iraq over to Iran yesterday? @BarackObama. We have gotten nothing from the Iraqis-- we should have them pay us back with oil.
12/13/2011 19:02:56	TweetDeck	Don't forget my book signing tonight at Costco on 1250 Old Country Road in Westbury, NY, from 6-8 pm. Hope to see you there.
12/13/2011 18:40:27	TweetDeck	The Mullahs are laughing at what they think is a very stupid president,@BarackObama has "asked" for Iran to return the drone #TimeToGetTough
12/13/2011 17:16:54	TweetDeck	Look, here's  the deal: @BarackObama has been a total disaster. He has spent this country into the ground and destroyed jobs #TimeToGetTough
12/13/2011 16:15:26	TweetDeck	We need a dealmaker in the White House, who knows how to think innovatively and make smart deals. #TimeToGetTough.
12/13/2011 15:50:31	TweetDeck	Tonight I will be signing copies of #TimeToGetTough in Westbury at Costco, 1250 Old Country Rd, from 6 pm to 8 pm
12/13/2011 15:35:10	TweetDeck	@Amazon sold out of #TimeToGetTough in the first week. More copies have been ordered for holidays. Don't worry.
12/12/2011 21:52:24	TweetDeck	@BarackObama has accumulated more debt in 3 years than the first 42 Presidents combined. He is simply out of control.
12/12/2011 21:31:28	TweetDeck	Why did @BarackObama let Iran keep our drone? Now it is going straight to the Chinese. He should have taken it out.
12/12/2011 21:15:55	TweetDeck	I was on a tele-townhall with @TeamBachmann and hosted her 4 times in Trump Tower yet she declined the Newsmax-@iontv debate. No loyalty.
12/12/2011 20:19:37	TweetDeck	If these guys have any integrity they'd say no to MSNBC -- a network that few watch and is very negative. @AndrewBreitbart re debate.
12/9/2011 21:35:33	TweetDeck	Excited that @OurCountryPAC's Amy Kremer has endorsed the Newsmax-iontv debate. The Tea Party Express is a great group.
12/9/2011 21:26:46	TweetDeck	Why was the Hanukah celebration held in the White House two weeks early? @BarackObama wants to vacation in Hawaii in late December. Sad.
12/9/2011 19:12:04	TweetDeck	Iowa Congressman @SteveKingIA has endorsed the Newsmax-@iontv debate. He has been doing great work in the House.
12/9/2011 18:27:42	TweetDeck	A  great crowd at Trump Tower for #TimeToGetTough book signing!
12/9/2011 18:25:36	TweetDeck	Excited that @OurCountryPAC's @Amy Kremer has endorsed the Newsmax-@iontv debate. The Tea Party Express is a great group.
12/9/2011 16:04:27	TweetDeck	If the GOP Establishment really wants to defeat @BarackObama then they should read #TimeToGetTough.
12/9/2011 16:00:15	TweetDeck	#TimeToGetTough presents bold solutions on taxes, national security, the debt, dealing with OPEC and China and defeating @BarackObama.

12/8/2011 20:46:47	TweetDeck	Why does @BarackObama continue to defend radical Islam? He is calling the Ft. Hood massacre "workplace violence."
12/8/2011 20:25:16	TweetDeck	You know what is the worst part of @BarackObama's Tuesday speech playing class warfare--we paid for it with our tax dollars.
12/8/2011 19:10:52	TweetDeck	Happy to have @ralphreed and the FFC's endorsement of the Newsmax-@iontv debate. FFC  is a great organization.
12/7/2011 18:27:58	TweetDeck	Why is the GOP establishment so threatened by the Newsmax - @iontv debate? More debate is always better.
12/6/2011 19:28:38	TweetDeck	President Reagan put it best: "Welfare's purpose should be to eliminate, as far as possible, the need for its own existence."
12/6/2011 16:52:24	TweetDeck	Forty -six million Americans---more than at any time ever in the history of this country--now live under the poverty line. #TimeToGetTough

12/2/2011 19:16:16	TweetDeck	We are building China's wealth by buying all their products, even though we make better products in America.
12/2/2011 18:44:14	TweetDeck	My new book tells some harsh truths and lays out some bold plans. Time for America to be #1 again.  #TimeToGetTough
12/2/2011 18:23:56	TweetDeck	Here's my message to @BarackObama: America is a capitalistic country. Get over it and get on with it!  #TimeToGetTough
12/2/2011 16:36:59	TweetDeck	The new job figures don't include 315,000 people who have given up looking for jobs.
12/2/2011 16:23:31	TweetDeck	He ruins the brand: @Robertgbeckel doesn't belong on @FoxNews . As CM for Mondale in '84, you lost 49 states. Sad!
12/2/2011 15:27:08	TweetDeck	If "The Art of the Deal" is a must read then #TimeToGetTough" is my opus.  It is available Dec 5th!
12/2/2011 15:11:02	TweetDeck	Meeting Former Speaker Newt Gingrich next week. On the Agenda---defeating @BarackObama.

12/1/2011 18:48:35	TweetDeck	He ruins the brand: @bobbeckel doesn't belong on @FoxNews. As CM for Mondale in '84, you  lost 49 states. Sad!
11/30/2011 19:50:15	TweetDeck	The unemployment numbers released later this week will show no job growth.  We must start making our own products again. #TimeToGetTough.
11/29/2011 21:03:45	TweetDeck	America's trade deficit with China is one of our greatest national security threats.  Time for Fair Trade. We must produce our own products.
11/29/2011 20:14:31	TweetDeck	The banks were bailed out by us. They should start lending to private entrepreneurs. The banks are slowing American growth.
11/29/2011 19:48:51	TweetDeck	In order to get elected, @BarackObama will start a war with Iran.
11/29/2011 19:27:19	TweetDeck	Iran's continued public threats of annihilating @Israel are unacceptable. Iran's nuclear drive must be stopped. #TimeToGetTough
11/29/2011 17:51:06	TweetDeck	Real unemployment is at over 21%. Businesses won't hire until @BarackObama is defeated in 2012. #TimeToGetTough
11/28/2011 20:45:01	TweetDeck	Third quarter GDP was lowered to 2% . There won't be any economic recovery until @BarackObama is defeated.
11/28/2011 19:44:00	Twitter Web Client	Why does @BarackObama support the radical Islamists in Egypt protests yet has such a high disregard for the Tea Party?
11/28/2011 19:31:52	TweetDeck	Washington will continue to run record deficits into the election. We are borrowing at a rate of $1.40 from China. Truly unsustainable.
11/28/2011 18:32:44	TweetDeck	Iran will soon take all of the oil in Iraq...and Iraq itself---Keep the oil.
11/28/2011 15:21:42	TweetDeck	The failure of the "Super Committee" shows Washington has truly incompetent leaders. #TimeToGetTough
11/23/2011 16:22:10	TweetDeck	American sanctions alone cannot stop Iran's nuclear drive--and @BarackObama cannot get China and Russia to agree on new Iranian sanctions.
11/23/2011 14:10:05	TweetDeck	Congratulations to @TrumpChicago, @TrumpSoHo and @TrumpLasVegas --all listed #1 on @TravelandLeisure World's Best Business Hotels

11/22/2011 21:15:50	TweetDeck	Why are we giving China foreign aid? Couldn't the Super Committee have agreed to at least cut that outlay? #TimeToGetTough
11/22/2011 20:12:42	TweetDeck	The habitual vacationer--@BarackObama--spent 9 days before the critical Super Committee deadline traveling.  He failed to lead, again.
11/22/2011 19:08:31	TweetDeck	As of September 30th, we have a record trade deficit with China of over $217Billion. They are ripping us off.  #TimeToGetTough
11/22/2011 17:09:10	TweetDeck	Yesterday @BarackObama actually spent a full day in Washington. He didn't campaign, fund raise or play golf. Shocking.
11/21/2011 21:58:22	TweetDeck	Egypt is turning into a hot bed of radical Islam. The current protest is another coup attempt.  We should never have abandoned Mubarak.
11/21/2011 21:03:56	TweetDeck	The House's failure to pass the Balance Budget Amendment was another unforced error by the GOP. Very disappointing.
11/21/2011 19:53:48	TweetDeck	When the Super Committee fails, @BarackObama will get exactly what he really wants--automatic cuts in defense spending. This is his plan.
11/21/2011 16:24:18	TweetDeck	If @BarackObama wanted the "Super Committee" to succeed, he would have lead. Instead he has been campaigning. Where is the leadership?
11/21/2011 14:20:52	TweetDeck	The Super Committee is finding ways to raise all our taxes without admitting it. The Republicans made a big mistake agreeing to this deal.
11/18/2011 21:18:20	TweetDeck	ObamaCare is one of the greatest threats our country faces.  It is unsustainable and will lead America into complete insolvency.
11/18/2011 20:34:39	TweetDeck	Why is @BarackObama delaying the sale of F-16 aircraft to Taiwan? Wrong message to send to China. #TimeToGetTough
11/18/2011 18:34:37	TweetDeck	Washington is simply incapable of any moderation because @BarackObama is such an extreme leftist.  He must be defeated. #TImeToGetTough.
11/18/2011 14:57:58	TweetDeck	Regardless of the USC's ruling, ObamaCare can only be defeated politically. It must be legislatively repealed or America will go bankrupt.
11/17/2011 20:51:25	TweetDeck	China is complaining about 2,500 marines being placed in Australia.  Meanwhile they are building bases across Latin America. #TimeToGetTough

11/9/2011 16:04:52	TweetDeck	Instead of trash talking @PMIsrael on the world stage, @BarackObama should be defending @Israel.
11/9/2011 15:31:33	TweetDeck	America should not be pressuring @Israel to show restraint against Iran. We should be working to stop Iran's nuclear drive.

11/8/2011 20:54:26	TweetDeck	Our deficits are caused by runaway spending, not inadequate taxing. Washington does not have a revenue problem.

11/2/2011 13:09:13	TweetDeck	Another company that the DOE has given money to just filed for bankruptcy. This is how the money we borrow at 40% from China is wasted.
11/1/2011 20:45:10	TweetDeck	The Republicans never should have agreed to this past summer's debt deal.  Military cuts will now come along with tax increases.

11/1/2011 19:17:16	TweetDeck	The Al Qaeda flag is now flying over Benghazi. @BarackObama spent over $3Billion of our money for this?

10/21/2011 14:14:18	TweetDeck	Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? What do we get out of this?
10/21/2011 13:23:48	TweetDeck	Why is  crude oil priced at $86/Barrel?  OPEC is  ripping us off. Not worth $30/Barrel.  America needs new leaders.
10/20/2011 19:15:48	TweetDeck	The OWS protesters are doing nothing to advance the interests of the 99%. Time for them to go home!
10/20/2011 18:26:08	TweetDeck	@BarackObama claims that all his choices were "the right ones." I am sure the 20% of Americans who are unemployed disagree.

10/18/2011 15:13:43	TweetDeck	Iran was planning to attack the Israeli and Saudi DC embassies. We should respond accordingly. The diplomatic  window is closed.

		Will be doing Fox and Friends in two minutes!
		Where is the President? It is time for him to come on TV and show strength against the repeated threats from North Korea -- and others.
		When is South Korea going to start paying us for the massive amounts of money we are spending to protect them from the North?
		What would you choose- Vampires or Cavemen? #CelebApprentice
		We must change the laws of our land and seek fair but rapid trials for the perpetrators of terrorist acts (Boston) with harsh punishment!
		The only American who has met with the North Korean man child is Dennis Rodman. Isn’t that frightening and sad?
		The $200M renovations at Trump @DoralResort are right on target. When completed, the course will be as good as it gets.
		Sexual pervert Anthony Weiner has zero business holding public office.
		Our President must be very careful with the 28 year old wack job in North Korea. At some point we may have to get very tough-blatant threats
		Our country should be worried about nuclear control far more than gun control--&amp; that one's not even close!
		My performance from last week on David Letterman @Late_Show will be re-aired tonight at 11:35 PM on CBS.
		My heart goes out to the people of Boston on this terrible day!
		My @foxandfriends interview re: @IvankaTrump's pregnancy, my grandchildren, Obama's 18% tax rate &amp; Obamacare
		love my DJT Ties
		It’s true—@dennisrodman gets the comeback of the year award. I didn’t like having to fire him. #CelebApprentice
		In case you missed it, my @gretawire interview on Obama's IRA rate cut hurting savings &amp; economic growth
		I'm getting ready to be inducted tonight into the WWE Hall of Fame at Madison Square Garden - a great honor for me and the Trump family!
		I never got a tattoo and never would!
		I am on David Letterman tonight.
		Get ready to turn to NBC for CELEBRITY APPRENTICE -- TONIGHT'S SHOW IS GREAT!
		From 10-11 pm, @ApprenticeNBC ranks #1 in 18-49 among ABC,CBS, and NBC. #CelebApprentice
		Despite firing @StephenBaldwin7 in last night's All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC, Stephen had strong overall performance this season
		China is pushing North Korea!
		China controls North Korea. So now besides cyber hacking us all day, they are using the Norks to taunt us. China is a major threat.
		Always remember that as your success grows, you will be asked for more favors. Learn how to say ‘No.’ It is critical.
		All eyes are on @TigerWoods @The_Masters. He’s in good position!
		A lot of comments re @MELANIATRUMP vs. Milania last week. I think spelling has taken on a new significance. #CelebApprentice
		.@pennjillette doesn’t like @StephenBaldwin7’s cliché line and Stephen says Penn creeps him out. Do we sense conflict yet? #CelebApprentice|
