05-11-2013 05:13:05	Twitter for Android	@MaxVayner Stewart (?) wouldn't have even a little chance in a debate with me. He's totally overrated - not fast enough or smart enough!
05-11-2013 03:43:25	Twitter for Android	@GuerrillaTycoon  Not even close - he is just, as you know, a very bad copy (who I profit from).
05-11-2013 03:40:20	Twitter for Android	@chef_riggy  I never endorsed Judd - I'm with Senator Mitch all the way!

04-30-2013 02:31:28	Twitter for Android	@ShawnGarrett   I should have many Emmys for The Apprentice if the process were fair-in any event, it's not my day job.                    ,
04-30-2013 01:15:16	Twitter for Android	@OMGguy18    Wrong, screen is too small-Samsung size is better.

04-24-2013 08:47:22	Twitter for Android	@RebeccaErin_   They were viciously attacking other people in the Park-nice guys?
04-24-2013 07:24:20	Twitter for Android	@bitchforshort  Victim never died so they would not have been given death penalty-but did you see what these "innocent" boys were doing?
04-24-2013 00:32:05	Twitter for Android	@HelmJoshua   Wind turbines will quadruple your electric bills and destroy the value of your home. Lot's of chicken soup however-bird kill.

10-27-2012 19:43:57	Twitter Web Client	@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy. But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy. Fight on John!

10-26-2012 15:21:33	Twitter Web Client	@MikeMpef Thanks, I hope you enjoyed it, had a great time.
10-26-2012 14:46:54	Twitter Web Client	@LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors--Obama should choose that as his $5M charity.
10-25-2012 18:07:33	Twitter Web Client	@politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting.
10-25-2012 17:56:24	Twitter Web Client	@michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost, hoped Obama would be great for U.S. --- he wasn't.
10-19-2012 19:34:57	Twitter Web Client	@rginn_1 Toledo is a great place--I've been there &amp; worked in Cincinnati for 2 years--I love Ohio.

09-18-2012 14:37:37	Twitter Web Client	@rdowns I never went bankrupt. Enemies love to say I did. Didn't happen.
09-14-2012 19:22:04	Twitter Web Client	@Shawn_Maynard  This is our 13th season. No precise date yet but most likely in the early spring. Shooting is underway. Will be terrific.

08-15-2012 20:50:20	Twitter Web Client	@GeorgeFWill is suggesting football is going away and @MittRomney will lose. @GeorgeFWill is a moron.

05-11-2012 19:57:56	Twitter Web Client	@AndyPettitte ratted out his best friend @RogerClemens in a ridiculous trial. Not nice! Who is rooting for Andy P?
05-01-2012 17:50:20	Twitter Web Client	@rupertmurdoch is a superb businessman and a world class CEO.He has built a tremendous empire and is certainly "fit" to run his corporation.
04-19-2012 16:50:30	Twitter Web Client	@MittRomney has shown last week that he will campaign aggressively against @BarackObama. I am confident he can defeat @BarackObama.
03-29-2012 18:19:58	Twitter Web Client	@marcorubio's endorsement of @MittRomney shows that the GOP is coalescing to defeat @BarackObama.
03-28-2012 16:03:52	TwitLonger Beta	@jayleno - my description of @MittRomney - "Future President" or "POTUS 45" or "@BarackObama's Worst Nightmare"
03-20-2012 17:29:13	Twitter Web Client	@MittRomney should consider Gov McDonnell of VA, Gov Christie of NJ and Senator Rubio of FL for VP. Really good men doing a really good job.
03-16-2012 17:18:10	Twitter Web Client	@BarackObama has wasted billions of our tax dollars on speculative green projects like Solyndra. He is an economic ignoramus.
03-14-2012 18:22:19	TwitLonger Beta	@NicolletteSheridan lost a big motion yesterday--she is entitled to nothing. The show made her--she should have been happy.
03-13-2012 20:36:30	Twitter Web Client	@MittRomney has won the most delegates, received the most votes and won the most states. The primary is over. Time to defeat @BarackObama.
02-29-2012 20:18:34	Twitter Web Client	@BarackObama should stop pressuring Israel against attacking Iran and worry how he will stop the Iranian nuclear drive. @BarackObama
02-22-2012 17:35:31	TwitLonger Beta	@CelebApprentice is having wonderful ratings once again. @IvankaTrump & @DonaldJTrumpJr. I am very proud of this season.

02-15-2012 20:12:10	Twitter Web Client	@kingdelrosario I like to invest in what I know, which tends to be real estate, but I keep an open mind.
02-15-2012 20:10:45	Twitter Web Client	@atlthrasher  I don't think it has run its course. There are opportunities. Finding them and maximizing them are key components for success.

02-15-2012 19:57:30	Twitter Web Client	@The_Joey  That could be a possibility but there are no plans at the moment. This season of Celebrity Apprentice is great--be sure to watch.
02-10-2012 22:06:52	Twitter Web Client	@BarackObama’s class warfare rhetoric is taking a backseat for the DNC convention.  He is charging $1 Million for a single suite.
02-10-2012 20:12:11	Twitter Web Client	@MittRomney will give a great speech at CPAC today. He understands the threat from China.
02-09-2012 16:02:53	Twitter Web Client	@Misterglorious  I wear suits from the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection.

11-15-2011 20:45:36	TweetDeck	@BarackObama has increased the EPA budget by over 150%.  The EPA is an impediment to both growth and jobs.  It sends jobs overseas.
11-15-2011 17:02:45	Twitter Web Client	@BarackObama has already added $5 Trillion to the national debt in less than 3 years. We must defeat him in 2012. #TimeToGetTough

10-20-2011 18:26:08	TweetDeck	@BarackObama claims that all his choices were "the right ones." I am sure the 20% of Americans who are unemployed disagree.
10-18-2011 14:16:47	TweetDeck	@BarackObama is holding Taiwan's request for 66 advanced F-16's. Wrong message to send to China.
10-07-2011 19:21:06	TweetDeck	@BarackObama is trying to pass another stimulus after the first was a complete failure. Does he really believe we are that stupid?

09-29-2011 15:23:32	TweetDeck	@JonHuntsman has zero chance of getting the nomination. Whoever said I wanted to meet him? Time is money and I don't waste mine.

09-06-2011 20:23:34	TweetDeck	@BarackObama trillion $ stimulus was supposed to create jobs -- instead it gave us more debt and higher unemployment.
09-06-2011 19:08:48	TweetDeck	@BarackObama wishes speeches could create jobs.  His job is costing America all of ours.
09-01-2011 17:54:59	TweetDeck	@BarackObama is so inept that I think he simply  made a mistake in originally scheduling the Joint Session on September 7th. Just sad.
08-29-2011 16:06:11	Twitter Web Client	@BarackObama MUST release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution.

08-19-2011 19:51:11	Twitter Web Client	@BarackObama is sure a master delegator. He has sent @Joe_Biden to China. The Chinese are laughing at us. We MUST do better.

08-17-2011 15:40:28	TweetDeck	@BarackObama has a record low 39% Gallup approval rating. Why so high?
08-15-2011 17:36:47	TweetDeck	@BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now he  heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard.  Nice work ethic.
07-28-2011 20:37:02	TweetDeck	@BarackObama has not released his own debt plan yet. He's totally lost, ineffective, desperate. GOP has its best chance to make a great deal
07-28-2011 19:38:24	TweetDeck	@Johnboehner  "The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it."  --The Art of the Deal
07-28-2011 17:56:38	TweetDeck	@KarlRove's @CrossroadsGPS new ad criticizes Obama for his excessive spending and debt, borrowing from China. Didn't Bush do the same thing?
