arnold schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the apprentice he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings not by me sad end to great show
how low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process this is nixon/watergate bad (or sick) guy
i'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that president obama was tapping my phones in october just prior to election
is it legal for a sitting president to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election turned down by court earlier a new low
just out the same russian ambassador that met jeff sessions visited the obama white house 22 times and 4 times last year alone
terrible just found out that obama had my "wires tapped" in trump tower just before the victory nothing found this is mccarthyism
the first meeting jeff sessions had with the russian amb was set up by the obama administration under education program for 100 ambs
it is so pathetic that the dems have still not approved my full cabinet
nick adams new book green card warrior is a must read the merit based system is the way to go canada australia @foxandfriends

intentional this whole narrative is a way of saving face for democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed
jeff sessions is an honest man he did not say anything wrong he could have stated his response more accurately but it was clearly not

the media has not reported that the national debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in obama first mo

fake news media knowingly doesn't tell the truth a great danger to our country the failing @nytimes has become a joke likewise @cnn sad

despite the long delays by the democrats in finally approving dr tom price the repeal and replacement of obamacare is moving fast
the democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election and so badly (306) so they made up a story russia fake news
fake news media which makes up stories and "sources" is far more effective than the discredited democrats but they are fading fast
the spotlight has finally been put on the low life leakers they will be caught
leaking and even illegal classified leaking has been a big problem in washington for years failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize
stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades great level of confidence and optimism even before tax plan rollout

our legal system is broken "77 percent of refugees allowed into us since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries" (wt) so dangerous
the failing @nytimes does major fake news china story saying "mrxi has not spoken to mr trump since nov14" we spoke at length yesterday
lawfare "remarkably in the entire opinion the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute" a disgraceful decision
see you in court the security of our nation is at stake
ryan died on a winning mission ( according to general mattis) not a "failure" time for the us to get smart and start winning again
long he doesn't know how to win anymore just look at the mess our country is in bogged down in conflict all over the place our hero
sen mccain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media only emboldens the enemy he's been losing so
chris cuomo in his interview with sen blumenthal never asked him about his long term lie about his brave "service" in vietnam fake news
senrichard blumenthal who never fought in vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie)now misrepresents what judge gorsuch told him
big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas while our people are far more vulnerable as we wait for what should be easy d

interview with @oreillyfactor on fox network 400 pm (prior to super bowl) enjoy
why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the federal court decision in boston which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision
because the ban was lifted by a judge many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country a terrible decision
what is our country coming to when a judge can halt a homeland security travel ban and anyone even with bad intentions can come into us
make america great again
after being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election the fake news @nytimes is still lost
the opinion of this so called judge which essentially takes law enforcement away from our country is ridiculous and will be overturned
interesting that certain middle eastern countries agree with the ban they know if certain people are allowed in it's death and destruction
when a country is no longer able to say who can and who cannot  come in and out especially for reasons of safety andsecurity big trouble
countries charge us companies taxes or tariffs while the us charges them nothing or littlewe should charge them same as they charge us
we must keep "evil" out of our country

iran is rapidly taking over more and more of iraq even after the us has squandered three trillion dollars there obvious long ago
everybody is arguing whether or not it is a ban call it what you want it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country
hope you like my nomination of judge neil gorsuch for the united states supreme court he is a good and brilliant man respected by all
getting ready to deliver a very important decision 800 pm

nancy pelosi and fake tears chuck schumer held a rally at the steps of the supreme court and mic did not work (a mess) just like dem party
the democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons they have nothing going but to obstruct now have an obama ag
i have made my decision on who i will nominate for the united states supreme court it will be announced live on tuesday at 800 pm (wh)
if the ban were announced with a one week notice the "bad" would rush into our country during that week a lot of bad "dudes" out there
there is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country this was a big part of my campaign study the world
protesters and the tears of senator schumer secretary kelly said that all is going well with very few problems make america safe again
only 109 people out of 325000 were detained and held for questioning big problems at airports were caused by delta computer outage
senators should focus their energies on isis illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start world war iii
the joint statement of former presidential candidates john mccain and lindsey graham is wrong they are sadly weak on immigration the two
christians in the middle east have been executed in large numbers we cannot allow this horror to continue
our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting now look what is happening all over europe and indeed the world a horrible mess
somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the fake news and failing @nytimes and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity
dwindling subscribers and readersthey got me wrong right from the beginning and still have not changed course and never will dishonest
thr coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost gas been so false and angry that the times actually apologized to its

thank you to linda bean of llbean for your great support and courage people will support you even more now buy llbean @lbperfectmaine
james clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated made up phony factstoo bad
we had a great news conference at trump tower today a couple of fake news organizations were there but the people truly get what's going on
intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public one last shot at meare we living in nazi germany
i win an election easily a great "movement" is verified and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with fake news a sorry state
russia has never tried to use leverage over me i have nothing to do with russia no deals no loans no nothing
russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "a complete and total fabrication utter nonsense" very unfair
fake news a total political witch hunt
ford said last week that it will expand in michigan and us instead of building a billion dollar plant in mexico thank you ford and fiat c

rupert murdoch is a great guy who likes me much better as a very successful candidate than he ever did as a very successful developer
dishonest media says mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly media is fake
before i or anyone saw the classified and/or highly confidential hacking intelligence report it was leaked out to @nbcnews so serious
kellyanne conway went to @meetthepress this morning for an interview with @chucktodd dishonest media cut out 9 of her 10 minutes terrible
i look very much forward to meeting prime minister theresa may in washington in the spring britain a longtime us ally is very special
congratulation to jane timken on her major upset victory in becoming the ohio republican party chair jane is a loyal trump supporter and star

have enough problems around the world without yet another one when i am president russia will respect us far more than they do now and
having a good relationship with russia is a good thing not a bad thing only "stupid" people or fools would think that it is bad we
only reason the hacking of the poorly defended dnc is discussed is that the loss by the dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed
intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results voting machines not touched
gross negligence by the democratic national committee allowed hacking to take placethe republican national committee had strong defense
monitoring the terrible situation in florida just spoke to governor scott thoughts and prayers for all stay safe
being a movie star and that was season 1 compared to season 14 now compare him to my season 1 but who cares he supported kasich and hillary
wow the ratings are in and arnold schwarzenegger got "swamped" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine djt so much for
hopefully all supporters and those who want to make america great again will go to dc on january 20th it will be a great show
and knew they were in big trouble which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minutethey saw a movement like never before
hillary and the dems were never going to beat the passion of my voters they saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the
the dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall (for sake of speed) will be paid back by mexico later
so how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers what is going on
the democratic national committee would not allow the fbi to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by russia
how did nbc get "an exclusive look into the top secret report he (obama) was presented" who gave them this report and why politics
toyota motor said will build a new plant in baja mexico to build corolla cars for us no way build plant in us or pay big border tax
to make up their own minds as to the truth the media lies to make it look like i am against "intelligence" when in fact i am a big fan
the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange wrong i simply state what he states it is for the people
time for republicans and democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works much less expensive and far better
do the typical political thing and blame the fact is obamacare was a lie from the beginning"keep you doctor keep your plan" it is
the democrats lead by head clown chuck schumer know how bad obamacare is and what a mess they are in instead of working to fix it they
jackie evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performancesome people just don't understand the "movement"
massive increases of obamacare will take place this year and dems are to blame for the mess it will fall of its own weight be careful
like the 116 percent hike in arizona also deductibles are so high that it is practically useless don't let the schumer clowns out of this web
republicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases
things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to h) a total double standard media as usual gave them a pass
somebody hacked the dnc but why did they not have "hacking defense" like the rnc has and why have they not responded to the terrible
thank you to ford for scrapping a new plant in mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the us this is just the beginning much more to follow
julian assange said "a 14 year old could have hacked podesta" why was dnc so careless also said russians did not give him the info
the "intelligence" briefing on so called "russian hacking" was delayed until friday perhaps more time needed to build a case very strange
i will be having a general news conference on january eleventh in nyc thank you
there should be no further releases from gitmo these are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield
may be their number one act and priority focus on tax reform healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance #dts
with all that congress has to work on do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog as unfair as it
the democrat governorof minnesota said "the affordable care act (obamacare) is no longer affordable" and it is lousy healthcare
people must remember that obamacare just doesn't work and it is not affordable 116 percent increases (arizona) bill clinton called it "crazy"
general motors is sending mexican made model of chevy cruze to us car dealers tax free across border make in usaor pay big border tax
china has been taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the us in totally one sided trade but won't help with north korea nice

i met some really great air force generals and navy admirals today talking about airplane capability and pricing very impressive people
i have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that i spent far less money on the win than hillary on the loss
i would have done even better in the election if that is possible if the winner was based on popular vote but would campaign differently
campaigning to win the electoral college is much more difficult and sophisticated than the popular vote hillary focused on the wrong states
yes it is true carlos slim the great businessman from mexico called me about getting together for a meeting we met he is a great guy
especially how to get people even with an unlimited budget out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more) they focused on wrong states
bill clinton stated that i called him after the election wrong he called me (with a very nice congratulations) he "doesn't know much" 
we did it thank you to all of my great supporters we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media)
today there were terror attacks in turkey switzerland and germany and it is only getting worse the civilized world must change thinking
if my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing they would be scorned and called terrible names

unless you catch "hackers" in the act it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking why wasn't this brought up before election

if the press would cover me accurately and honorably i would have far less reason to "tweet" sadly i don't know if that will ever happen
their country (the us doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the south china sea i don't think so
did china ask us if it was ok to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete) heavily tax our products going into
@foxnews will be re running "objectified donald trump" the ratings hit produced by the great harvey levin of tmz at 800 pm enjoy
the green party just dropped its recount suit in pennsylvania and is losing votes in wisconsin recount just a stein scam to raise money
expensive mistake the united states is open for business
these companies are able to move between all 50 states with no tax or tariff being charged please be forewarned prior to making a very 
wanting to sell their product cars ac units etc back across the border this tax will make leaving financially difficult but
without retribution or consequence is wrong there will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35 percent for these companies 
fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country and then thinks it will sell its product back into the us 
the us is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses but any business that leaves our country for another country
just tried watching saturday night live unwatchable totally biased not funny and the baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse sad
rexnord of indiana is moving to mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers this is happening all over our country no more
interesting how the us sells taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but i should not accept a congratulatory call
the president of taiwan called me today to wish me congratulations on winning the presidency thank you

great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to make america great again while i am not mandated to 
i will be holding a major news conference in new york city with my children on december 15 to discuss the fact that i will be leaving my

my thoughts and prayers are with the great people of tennessee during these terrible wildfires stay safe
nobody should be allowed to burn the american flag if they do there must be consequences perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail
i thought that @cnn would get better after they failed so badly in their support of hillary clinton however since election they are worse
the great state of michigan was just certified as a trump win giving all of our make america great again supporters another victory 306
@cnn is so embarrassed by their total (100 percent) support of hillary clinton and yet her loss in a landslide that they don't know what to do
just met with general petraeus was very impressed
if cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the cuban people the cuban/american people and the us as a whole i will terminate deal
serious voter fraud in virginia new hampshire and california so why isn't the media reporting on this serious bias big problem
states instead of the 15 states that i visited i would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)
it would have been much easier for me to win the so called popular vote than the electoral college in that i would only campaign in 3 or 4 
in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
trump is going to be our president we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead" so much time and money will be spent same result sad
this election that is a direct threat to our democracy" she then said "we have to accept the results and look to the future donald 
of position" then separately she stated "he said something truly horrifying  he refused to say that he would respect the results of 
during a general election i for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind 
and fair elections we've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a 
hillary's debate answer on delay "that is horrifying that is not the way our democracy works been around for 240 years we've had free 
hillary clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in nothing will change
the democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted not so anymore
the green party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated and demoralized dems
fidel castro is dead
i am working hard even on thanksgiving trying to get carrier ac company to stay in the us (indiana) making progress will know soon

the failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high i can fully understand that but why announce
perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes in the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone
i cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment not nice
many people would like to see @nigel_farage represent great britain as their ambassador to the united states he would do a great job

very organized process taking place as i decide on cabinet and many other positions i am the only one who knows who the finalists are

the media refuses to talk about the three new national polls that have me in first place biggest crowds ever watch what happens
just returned from pennsylvania where we will be bringing back their jobs amazing crowd will be going back tomorrow to gettysburg
the results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous i won thank you these are very exciting times
when obama took office in 2009 employer provided premiums cost $13375 today they are $18142 thanks obama
why didn't hillary clinton announce that she was inappropriately given the debate questions she secretly used them crooked hillary
that was really exciting made all of my points make america great again
we cannot take four more years of barack obama and that’s what you’ll get if you vote for hillary #bigleaguetruth
i started this campaign to make america great again that’s what i’m going to do #maga #debate
usa has the greatest business people in the world but we let political hacks negotiate our deals we need change #bigleaguetruth #debate
bernie sanders on hrc bad judgement john podesta on hrc bad instincts #bigleaguetruth #debate
moderator “respectfully you won’t answer the pay to play question” #debate #bigleaguetruth
our country is stagnant we’ve lost jobs and business we don’t make things anymore b/c of the bill hillary’s husband signed and she blessed
i will renegotiate nafta if i can’t make a great deal we’re going to tear it up we’re going to get this economy running again #debate
moderator hillary plan calls for more regulation and more government spending #debate #bigleaguetruth
moderator hillary paid $225000 by a brazilian bank for a speech that called for “open borders” that’s a quote #debate #bigleaguetruth
hillary is too weak to lead on border security no solutions no ideas no credibility she supported nafta worst deal in us history #debate
one of my first acts as president will be to deport the drug lords and then secure the border #debate #maga
drugs are pouring into this country if we have no border we have no country that’s why ice endorsed me #debate #bigleaguetruth
@hillaryclinton lists litany of ways she plans to restrict gun rights 2a will not survive a hillary presidency #debate #bigleaguetruth
the 2nd amendment is under siege we need scotus judges who will uphold the us constitution #debate #bigleaguetruth
ready to lead ready to make america great again #debate #maga
new polls are good because the media has deceived the public by putting women front and center with made up stories and lies and got caught
wow new polls just came out from @cnn great numbers especially after total media hit job leading ohio 48 44
voter fraud crooked hillary clinton even got the questions to a debate and nobody says a word can you imagine if i got the questions
we have all got to come together and win this election we can't have four more years of obama (or worse)
of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day why do republican leaders deny what is going on so naive
can't believe these totally phoney stories 100 percent made up by women (many already proven false) and pushed big time by press have impact
all safe in orange county north carolina with you all the way will never forget now we have to win proud of you all @ncgop
animals representing hillary clinton and dems in north carolina just firebombed our office in orange county because we are winning @ncgop
wow interview released by wikileakes shows "quid pro quo" in crooked hillary email probe such a dishonest person and paul ryan does zilch
finally in the new abc news/washington post poll hillary clinton is down 11 points with women voters and the election is close at 47 43
paul ryan a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago) must start focusing on the budget military vets etc
the democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked hillary clinton we have paul ryan always fighting the republican nominee
the election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing crooked hillary but also at many polling places sad
election is being rigged by the media in a coordinated effort with the clinton campaign by putting stories that never happened into news
polls close but can you believe i lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events that never happened media rigging election
watched saturday night live hit job on metime to retire the boring and unfunny show alec baldwin portrayal stinks media rigging election
a great day in new hampshire and maine fantastic crowds and energy #maga
the failing @nytimes reporters don't even call us anymore they just write whatever they want to write making up sources along the way
nothing ever happened with any of these women totally made up nonsense to steal the election nobody has more respect for women than me
hillary clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election
this election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges and outright lies in order to elect crooked hillary
100 percent fabricated and made up charges pushed strongly by the media and the clinton campaign may poison the minds of the american voter fix
crooked hillary clinton likes to talk about the things she will do but she has been there for 30 years why didn't she do them
wow @cnn town hall questions were given to crooked hillary clinton in advance of big debates against bernie sanders hillary and cnn fraud
in texas now leaving soon for big rally in florida
the very foul mouthed sen john mccain begged for my support during his primary (i gave he won) then dropped me over locker room remarks
with the exception of cheating bernie out of the nom the dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the republicans
our very weak and ineffective leader paul ryan had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty
wow @cnn got caught fixing their "focus group" in order to make crooked hillary look better really pathetic and totally dishonest
paul ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee
thank you for all of the great comments on the debate last night very exciting
hypocrite @hillaryclinton is the single biggest beneficiary of citizens united in history by far #debate #bigleaguetruth
our country has the slowest growth since 1929 #bigleaguetruth #debate
this country cannot take four more years of barack obama #debate
we agree @potus "she'll (hillary clinton) say anything and change nothing it's time to turn the page" president obama
if @hillaryclinton is president she’ll be all talk and nothing will get done #debate #bigleaguetruth
in my administration every american will be treated equally protected equally and honored equally #debate #bigleaguetruth
hypocrite @hillaryclinton claims she needs a “public and a private stance” in discussions with wall street banks #debate
@hillaryclinton  bill “clarified” what he meant when calling obamacare a “disaster” actually “disaster” is pretty clear #debate
we must repeal obamacare and replace it with a much more competitive comprehensive affordable system #debate #maga
hillary’s 33000 deleted emails about her daughter’s wedding that’s a lot of wedding emails #debate
basically nothing hillary has said about her secret server has been true #crookedhillary
there’s never been anyone more abusive to women in politics than bill clintonmy words were unfortunate the clintons’ actions were far worse
i’m not proud of my locker room talk but this world has serious problems we need serious leaders #debate #bigleaguetruth
it’s this simple “make america great again” #debate #bigleaguetruth
so many self righteous hypocrites watch their poll numbers and elections go down
tremendous support (except for some republican "leadership") thank you

remember don't believe "sources said" by the very dishonest media if they don't name the sources the sources don't exist
did crooked hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) alicia m become a us citizen so she could use her in the debate
using alicia m in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that crooked hillary suffers from bad judgement hillary was set up by a con
wow crooked hillary was duped and used by my worst miss u hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past which is terrible
anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying "sources said" do not believe it there are no sources they are just made up lies
wow did you see how badly @cnn (clinton news network) is doing in the ratings with people like @donlemon who could expect any more
my condolences to those involved in today's horrible accident in nj and my deepest gratitude to all of the amazing first responders

the great state of arizona where i just had a massive rally (amazing people) has a very weak and ineffective senator jeff flake sad
the republican party needs strong and committed leaders not weak people such as @jeffflake if it is going to stop illegal immigration
crooked hillary's vp pick said this morning that i was not aware that russia took over crimea a total lie and taken over during o term
wow the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on crooked's fbi release they are at the back of the pack no longer a credible source
@cnn is so disgusting in their bias but they are having a hard time promoting crooked hillary in light of the new email scandals
great visit to detroit church fantastic reception and all @cnn talks about is a small protest outside inside a large and wonderful crowd
i visited our trump tower campaign headquarters last night after returning from ohio and arizona and it was packed with great pros win
people will be very surprised by our ground game on nov 8 we have an army of volunteers and people with great spirit they want to #maga
just heard that crazy and very dumb @morningmika had a mental breakdown while talking about me on the low ratings @morning_joe joe a mess
poll numbers way up making big progress
thank you to @foxandfriends for the great review of the speech on immigration last night thank you also to the great people of arizona
mexico will pay for the wall
great trip to mexico today wonderful leadership and high quality people look forward to our next meeting
former president vicente fox who is railing against my visit to mexico today also invited me when he apologized for using the "f bomb"
from day one i said that i was going to build a great wall on the southern border and much more stop illegal immigration watch wednesday
now that african americans are seeing what a bad job hillary type policy and management has done to the inner cities they want trump
crooked hillary's brainpower is highly overrated probably why her decision making is so bad or as stated by bernie s she has bad judgement
does anyone know that crooked hillary who tried so hard was unable to pass the bar exams in washington dc she was forced to go elsewhere
heroin overdoses are taking over our children and others in the midwest coming in from our southern border we need strong border and wall
how quickly people forget that crooked hillary called african american youth "super predators" has she apologized
i am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion such a big problem for our country i will solve
wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @msnbc by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @morning_joe apologize
what do african americans and hispanics have to lose by going with me look at the poverty crime and educational statistics i will fix it
crooked hillary will never be able to solve the problems of poverty education and safety within the african american and hispanic communities
hillary clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me no policy and always very short (stamina) media gives her a pass
so many in the african american community are doing so badly poverty and crime way up employment and jobs way down i will fix it promise
poll numbers are starting to look very good leading in florida @cnn arizona and big jump in utah all numbers rising national way up wow
hillary clinton strongly stated that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of the state department lie
it is being reported by virtually everyone and is a fact that the media pile on against me is the worst in american political history
i am now in texas doing a big fundraiser for the republican party and a @foxnews special on the border and with victims of border crime
just leaving akron ohio after a packed rally amazing people going now to texas
will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 830 am eastern enjoy
some day when things calm down i'll tell the real story of @joenbc and his very insecure long time girlfriend @morningmika two clowns
tried watching low rated @morning_joe this morning unwatchable @morningmika is off the wall a neurotic and not very bright mess
i heard that @morning_joe was very nice on friday but that little donny d a big failure in tv (and someone i helped) was nasty irrelevant
crooked hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads all paid for by her bosses on wall street media is protecting her
i have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds but the media refuses to show or discuss them something very big is happening
will be interviewed on @judgejeanine at 900 pm enjoy
just leaving virginia really big crowd great enthusiasm
certain republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the ussupreme court get proper appointments sad
stay on message is the chant i always do trade jobs military vets 2nd a repeal ocare borders etc but media misrepresents
i have always been the same person remain true to selfthe media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so
it is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false
i am not only fighting crooked hillary i am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process people get it
crooked hillary clinton is being protected by the media she is not a talented person or politician the dishonest media refuses to expose
my rallies are not covered properly by the media they never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm
if the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words i say i would be beating hillary by 20 percent
the failing @nytimes which never spoke to me keeps saying that i am saying to advisers that i will change false i am who i am never said
the failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened their reporting is fiction the media protects hillary
we now have confirmation as to one reason crooked h wanted to be sure that nobody saw her emails pay for play how can she run for pres
i am truly enjoying myself while running for president the people of our country are amazing great numbers on november 8th
the failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction their stories about me always quote non existent unnamed sources very dishonest
isis gained tremendous strength during hillary clinton's term as secretary of state when will the dishonest media report the facts
i love watching these poor pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out they can't
a massive tax increase will be necessary to fund crooked hillary clinton's agenda what a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday
ratings challenged @cnn reports so seriously that i call president obama (and clinton) "the founder" of isis and mvp they don't get sarcasm
@dbongino you were fantastic in defending both the second amendment and me last night on @cnn don lemon is a lightweight dumb as a rock
when is the media going to talk about hillary's policies that have gotten people killed like libya open borders and maybe her emails
i am running against the washington insiders just like i did in the republican primaries these are the people that have made us a mess
will be interviewed on @foxandfriends now
being in detroit today was wonderful quick stop in ohio to meet with some of our great supporters just got back home
my economic policy speech will be carried live at 1215 pm enjoy
michael morell the lightweight former acting director of cia and a man who has made serious bad calls is a total clinton flunky
the media is going crazy they totally distort so many things on purpose crimea nuclear "the baby" and so much more very dishonest
i see where mayor stephanie rawlings blake of baltimore is pushing crooked hard look at the job she has done in baltimore she is a joke
i am not just running against crooked hillary clinton i am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media but i will win
heading to new hampshire will be talking about hillary saying her brain short circuited and other things
anybody whose mind "short circuits" is not fit to be our president look up the word "brainwashed"
crooked hillary said loudly and for the world to see that she "short circuited" when answering a question on her emails very dangerous
hillary clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions let us all see what happens
the plane i saw on television was the hostage plane in geneva switzerland not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to iran
our incompetent secretary of state hillary clinton was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars in cash to iran scandal
there is great unity in my campaign perhaps greater than ever before i want to thank everyone for your tremendous support beat crooked h
great day in virginia crowd was fantastic
president obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the united states
so with all of the obama tough talk on russia and the ukraine they have already taken crimea and continue to push that's what i said
when i said in an interview that putin is "not going into ukraine you can mark it down" i am saying if i am president already in crimea
this story is not about mr khan who is all over the place doing interviews but rather radical islamic terrorism and the us get smart
mr khan who does not know me viciously attacked me from the stage of the dnc and is now all over tv doing the same nice
wow it is unbelievable how distorted one sided and biased the media is against us the failing @nytimes is a joke @cnn is laughable
the dishonest media is fawning over the democratic convention i wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than crooked h
i was viciously attacked by mr khan at the democratic convention am i not allowed to respond hillary voted for the iraq war not me
captain khan killed 12 years ago was a hero but this is about radical islamic terror and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it
nielson media research final numbers on acceptance speech trump 322 million clinton 278 million thank you
thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the republican national convention #1 over crooked hillary and dems
can you imagine if i had the small crowds that hillary is drawing today in pennsylvania it would be a major media event @cnn @foxnews
wow nato's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must pay their bills this is a general i will like
the "rust belt" was created by politicians like the clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like mexico end
crooked's stop in johnstown pennsylvania where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians drew less than 200 with bill vp
word is that crooked hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in pennsylvania perhaps it is because her husband signed nafta
i turned down a meeting with charles and david koch much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better
why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "big thursdays" when crooked hillary and i made our speeches republican's won ratings
just got back from colorado the love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible big crowds
i am watching crooked hillary speak same old stuff our country needs change
wow my campaign is hearing from more and more bernie supporters that they will never support crooked hillary she sold them out vp pick
the dishonest media didn't mention that bernie sanders was very angry looking during crooked's speech he wishes he didn't make that deal
crooked hillary said that i "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign" reallyi just beat 16 people and am beating her
if michael bloomberg ran again for mayor of new york he wouldn't get 10 percent of the vote they would run him out of town #neverhillary
little michael bloomberg who never had the guts to run for president knows nothing about me his last term as mayor was a disaster
general john allen who i never met but spoke against me last night failed badly in his fight against isis his record = bad #neverhillary
crooked hillary clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech many of her statements were lies and fabrications
two policemen just shot in san diego one dead it is only getting worse people want law and order
crooked hillary clinton made up facts about me and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country in her very average scream
the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke @cnn and the little watched @morning_joe = sad
president obama spoke last night about a world that doesn’t exist 70 percent of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction #dnc
not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complaining then a small one pathetic
our not very bright vice president joe biden just stated that i wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy sorry joe that was ted cruz
crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about the danger is massive no
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally get tough
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country no recognition sad
funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said "trump is a genius" america 1st
as i have been saying crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election despite her statements to the contrary top adv
many of bernie's supporters have left the arena did bernie go home and go to sleep
i hate to say it but the republican convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the democratic convention
no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible highly overrated
you have no idea what my strategy on isis is and neither does isis (a good thing) please get your facts straight thanks @megynkelly
for the record i have zero investments in russia
in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump crazy
pocahontas bombed last night sad to watch
why aren't the democrats speaking about isis bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order the republican convention was great
funny if you listen to @foxnews the democrats did not have a good day if you listen to the other two they are fawning what a difference
bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton all of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it waste of time
elizabeth warren often referred to as pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary who she always hated
i was at @foxnews and met juan williams in passing he asked if he could have pictures taken with me i said fine he then trashes on air
hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold he got nothing for all of the time energy and money the vp a joke
great poll numbers are coming out all over people don't want another four years of obama and crooked hillary would be even worse #maga
the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change
wow the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess but fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn
here we go again with another clinton scandal and emails yet (can you believe) crooked hillary knew the fix was in b never had a chance
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the dnc they just got caught that's all they laughed at bernie
if bernie sanders after seeing the just released emails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same
hillary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened
how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb emails using even religion against bernie
the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc emails which should never have been written (stupid) because putin likes me
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes no way they are going to fix america's problems isis and all others laughing
the ratings for the republican national convention were very good but for the final night my speech great thank you
the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory she's out
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing emails say the rigged system is alive and well
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength i don't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top dws too bad bernie flamed out
if the republican convention had blown up with emails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player (bernie) media would go wild
the @cnn panels are so one sided almost all against trump @foxnews is so much better and the ratings are much higher don't watch cnn
i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted no energy left
sorry folks but bernie sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer he is trying to dismiss the new emails and dnc disrespect sad
there is no longer a bernie sanders "political revolution" he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates
looks like the bernie people will fight if not their blood sweat and tears was a total waste of time kaine stands for opposite
wow president obama's brother malik just announced that he is voting for me was probably treated badly by president like everybody else
bernie sanders started off strong but with the selection of kaine for vp is ending really weak so much for a movement total disrespect
the crooked hillary vp choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters just another case of bad judgement by h
thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night from the heart
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together isis and our other enemies are drooling they don't look presidential to me
i will bring jobs back and get wages up people haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years clinton killed jobs
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved job killer
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs i will bring jobs back
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania against steelworkers and miners husband signed nafta
leaked emails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders mock his heritage and much more on line from wikileakes really vicious rigged
pocahontas wanted vp slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the senate also crooked hillary hates her
tim kaine is and always has been owned by the banks bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice bernie fought for nothing
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for philly fight
i highly recommend the just out book the field of fight by general michael flynn how to defeat radical islam
is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and didn't get indicted while bob m did
another attack this time in germany many killed god bless the people of munich
one of the best produced including the incredible stage and set in the history of conventions great unity big tv ratings @karlrove
thank you cleveland we love you and will be back many times
what a great four days in cleveland so proud of the great job done by the rnc and all the police and secret service were fantastic
other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses the party is very united great love in the arena
ted cruz talks about the constitution but doesn't say that if the dems win the presidency the new justices appointed will destroy us all
i am soooo proud of my children don eric and tiffany their speeches under enormous pressure were incredible ivanka intros me tonight
arena was packed totally electric
@mike_pence was fantastic tonight will be a great vp
wow ted cruz got booed off the stage didn't honor the pledge i saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway no big deal
#texttrump88022 for exclusive @realdonaldtrump updates we will make america great again
thank you to governor @scottwalker for such warm support great speech
john kasich was never asked by me to be vp just arrived in cleveland will be a great two days
the media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of melania's speech than the fbi spent on hillary's emails
good news is melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press
in november i think the people of ohio will remember that the republicans picked cleveland instead of going to another state jobs
bill hemmer of @foxnews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena more than in past years
congratulations to my children don and tiffany on having done a fantastic job last night i am very proud of you
such a great honor to be the republican nominee for president of the united states i will work hard and never let you down america first
the roll call is beginning at the republican national convention very exciting
networks other than low ratings @cnn have been very fair and exciting
@cnn is the worstthey go to their dumb one sided panels when a podium speaker is for trump vast majority want make america great again
looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife melania place looks beautiful
president obama just had a news conference but he doesn't have a clue our country is a divided crime scene and it will only get worse
our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching we are not looking good we are not looking smart we are not looking tough
i will be on @60minutes tonight at 700 pm with mike pence talking about law and order and many other subjects bad times for divided usa
we are trying to fight isis and now our own people are killing our police our country is divided and out of control the world is watching
the ratings at @foxnews blow away the ratings of @cnn not even close that's because cnn is the clinton news network and people don't like
@foxnews is much better and far more truthful than @cnn which is all negative guests are stacked for crooked hillary i don't watch
if goofy elizabeth warren a very weak senator didn't lie about her heritage (being native american) she would be nothing today pick her h
i hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren sometimes referred to as pocahontas as her vp then we can litigate her fraud
it doesn't matter that crooked hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made bernie said she has bad judgement
as the days and weeks go by we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in crooked hillary clinton led obama into bad decisions
we are going to have a great time in cleveland will lead to special results for our country we will make america great again
goofy elizabeth warren who may be the least productive senator in the us senate must prove she is not a fraud without the con it's over
thank you to jack morgan tamara neo cheryl ann kraft and all of my friends and supporters in virginia great job
thank you to chris cox and bikers for trump your support has been amazing i will never forget make america great again
crooked hillary clinton is bought and paid for by wall street lobbyists and special interests she will sell our country down the tubes
very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes crooked hillary clinton can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money
crooked hillary who embarrassed herself and the country with her email lies has been a disaster on foreign policy look what's happening
crooked hillary is spending big wall street money on ads saying i don't have foreign policy experience yet look what her policies have done
look forward to introducing governor mike pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great state of indiana) my first choice from start
look forward to governor mike pence vp introduction tomorrow in new york city
i am pleased to announce that i have chosen governor mike pence as my vice presidential running mate news conference tomorrow at 1100 am
four more years of weakness with a crooked hillary administration is not acceptable look what has happened to the world with o and hillary
#nevertrump is never more they were crushed last night in cleveland at rules committee by a vote of 87 12 make america great again
in light of the horrible attack in nice france i have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my vice presidential announcement
another horrific attack this time in nice france many dead and injured when will we learn it is only getting worse
justice ginsburg of the us supreme court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me her mind is shot resign
i am somewhat surprised that bernie sanders was not true to himself and his supporters they are not happy that he is selling out
bernie sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton he will endorse her today fans angry
crime is out of control and rapidly getting worse look what is going on in chicago and our inner cities not good
i heard that the underachieving john king of @cnn on inside politics was one hour of lies happily few people are watching dead network
the media is so dishonest if i make a statement they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolishthey think the public is stupid
president obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think he is living in a world of the make believe
look what is happening to our country under the weak leadership of obama and people like crooked hillary clinton we are a divided nation
way to go @serenawilliams you are a true champion proud of you
prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country
after today crooked hillary can officially be called lyin' crooked hillary
just leaving dc had great meetings with republicans in the house and senate very interesting day these are people who love our country
convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow let today be devoted to crooked hillary and the rigged system under which we live
i have over seven million hits on social media re crooked hillary clinton check it out sleepy eyes @markhalperin @nbcpolitics
sleepy eyes chuck todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it againhe could not have watched my standing ovation speech in nc
even the once great caesars is bankrupt in ac others to follow ask the democrat city council what happened to atlantic city
hillary clinton should ask why the democrat pols in atlantic city made all the wrong moves convention center airport and destroyed city
i made a lot of money in atlantic city and left 7 years ago great timing (as all know) pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies
crooked hillary clinton lied to the fbi and to the people of our country she is sooooo guilty but watch her time will come
crooked hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement
crooked hillary clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information" not fit
crooked hillary clinton is unfit to serve as president of the us her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong bad judgement
i don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed crooked hillary to get away with "murder" come november 8 she's out
raised a lot of money for the republican party there will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning lots of support win
looking forward to meeting with @senbobcorker in a little while we will be traveling to north carolina together today
fbi director said crooked hillary compromised our national security no charges wow #riggedsystem
the system is rigged general petraeus got in trouble for far less very very unfair as usual bad judgment
it was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday she has done a fantastic job for the people of iowa and us will see her again
taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of air force one on the campaign trail by president obama and crooked hillary a total disgrace
on @foxnews at 700 pm "special meet the trumps" hope you enjoy
why is president obama allowed to use air force one on the campaign trail with crooked hillary she is flying with him tomorrow who pays
with hillary and obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse politically correct fools won't even call it what it is radical islam
crooked hillary clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt where are the 33000 missing emails
the only people who are not interested in being the vp pick are the people who have not been asked
i look forward to meeting @joniernst today in new jersey she has done a great job as senator of iowa
spent time with indiana governor mike pence and family yesterday very impressed great people
senator tom cotton was great on meet the press yesterday despite a totally one sided interview by chuck todd the end result was solid
dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff's star or plain star
crooked hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis it will just go on forever we need change
the third mass attack (slaughter) in days by isis 200 dead in baghdad worst in many years we do not have leadership that can stop this
in bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by isis terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the koran 20 were killed
i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the usag so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught
the secret meeting between bill clinton and the usag in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting "go away no pictures"
does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the usag talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac
the system is rigged
on saturday a great man elie wiesel passed awaythe world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil
crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the usag to work out a deal the system is totally rigged and corrupt
only a fool would believe that the meeting between bill clinton and the usag was not arranged or that crooked hillary did not know
just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me chuck todd and the entire show is against methe good news the people get it
it was just announced by sources that no charges will be brought against crooked hillary clinton like i said the system is totally rigged
it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton what she did was wrong what bill did was stupid
the speakers slots at the republican convention are totally filled with a long waiting list of those that want to speak wednesday release
just read in the failing @nytimes that i was not aware "the event had to be held in cleveland" a total lie these people are sick
just returned from colorado amazing crowd
new book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read #wakeupamerica
for reasons only they can explain the @uschamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better
tremendous day in massachusetts and maine thank you to everyone for making it so special
i will be on @oreillyfactor at 800 pm enjoy
just watched senator john barrasso on @foxnews he was great thank you john
why would the uschamber be upset by the fact that i want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that i want penalties for cheaters
the @uschamber must fight harder for the american worker china and many others are taking advantage of us with our terrible trade pacts
iron mike tyson was not asked to speak at the convention though i'm sure he would do a good job if he was the media makes everything up
we must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the united states
yet another terrorist attack this time in turkey will the world ever realize what is going on so sad
hillary clinton’s presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country she is ill fit with bad judgment
benghazi is just another hillary clinton failure it just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with clinton
@cnn is all negative when it comes to me i don't watch it anymore
the media is unrelenting they will only go with and report a story in a negative light i called brexit (hillary was wrong) watch november
crooked hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the us senate goofy elizabeth warren who lied on heritage
the "dirty" poll done by @abc @washingtonpost is a disgrace even they admit that many more democrats were polled other polls were good
crooked hillary clinton got brexit wrong i said leave will win she has no sense of markets and such bad judgement only a question of time
hillary clinton is not a change agent just the same old status quo she is spending a fortune i am spending very little close in polls
people in our country want borders and without them the old line pols like crooked hillary will not win it is time for change and jobs
the @abc poll sample is heavy on democrats very dishonest why would they do that other polls good
crooked hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at turnberry shows me hitting shot but i never did = lie was there to support son
clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on brexit with big dollar ads disgraceful
crooked hillary clinton who called brexit 100 percent wrong (along with obama) is now spending wall street money on an ad on my correct call
george will one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago) has left the republican partyhe's made many bad calls
just landed in new york a one night stay in scotland turnberry came out magnificently my son eric did a great job under budget
so funny crooked hillary called brexit so incorrectly and now she says that she is the one to deal with the uk all talk no action
hillary clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency  donald j trump
thank you to donald rumsfeld for the endorsement very much appreciated clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying"
hillary says things can't change i say they have to change it's a choice between americanism and her corrupt globalism #imwithyou
crooked hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief she will be a disaster for jobs and the economy
i will be interviewed by @loudobbs tonight on @foxbusiness 7pm et
hillary defrauded america as secy of state she used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich corrupt dangerous dishonest
if you want to know about hillary clinton's honesty and judgment ask the family of ambassador stevens
hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays
i am "the king of debt"that has been great for me as a businessman but is bad for the country i made a fortune off of debt will fix us
how can hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk

goofy elizabeth warren sometimes referred to as pocahontas pretended to be a native american in order to advance her career very racist

the great boxing promoter don king just endorsed me nice
pocahontas is at it again goofy elizabeth warren one of the least productive us senators has a nasty mouth hope she is vp choice

crooked hillary clinton will be a disaster on jobs the economy trade healthcare the military guns and just about all else obama plus
as expected the media is very much against me their dishonesty is amazing but just like our big wins in the primaries we will win
bernie sanders must really dislike crooked hillary after the way she played him many of his supporters because of trade will come to me

crooked hillary is being badly criticized (for a wall street paid for ad) by politifact for a false ad on me on women she is a total fraud

have a great memorial day and remember that we will soon make america great again
the endorsement of me by the 16500 border patrol agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate nice
in getting the endorsement of the 16500 border patrol agents (thank you) the statement was made that the wall was very necessary
obama says a wall at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at wh
the republican party has to be smart and strong if it wants to win in november can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler indie candidate

goofy senator elizabeth warren @elizabethforma has done less in the us senate than practically any other senator all talk no action
@elizabethforma goofy elizabeth warren sometimes known as pocahontas bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing total hypocrite
@elizabethforma goofy elizabeth warren sometimes referred to as pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native american is a lowlife
great rally in new mexico amazing crowd now in la big rally in anaheim
crooked hillary clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement
i just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the fec even the dishonest media thinks great
amazingly with all of the money i have raised for the vets i have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media
much of the money i have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups
while under no obligation to do so i have raised between 5 and 6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our veterans nice
i will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor at 800 pm enjoy
obama’s va secretary just said we shouldn't measurewait times hillary says va problems are not ‘widespread’ i will take care ofour vets
in trade military and everything else it will be america first this will quickly lead to our ultimate goal make america great again
the american people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists
bernie sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that crooked hillary clinton will be forced out of the race email scandal
hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad would be four more years of stupidity
crooked hillary said that i want guns brought into the school classroom wrong
crooked hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed no more guns to protect hillary
while our wonderful president was out playing golf all day the tsa is falling apart just like our government airports a total disaster
crooked hillary is spending tremendous amounts of wall street money on false ads against me she is a very dishonest person
crooked hillary clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment no gun owner can ever vote for clinton
thank you @thetodaysgolfer for the wonderful statement that "the new par 3 9th hole @trump turnberry could be the most dramatic in britain"

crooked hillary can't even close the deal with bernie and the dems have it rigged in favor of hillary four more years of this no way
crooked hillary clinton looks presidential i don't think so four more years of obama and our country will never come back isis laughs
look where the world is today a total mess and isis is still running around wild i can fix it fast hillary has no chance
crooked hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina isis china russia and all would love for her to be president 4 more years
i said that crooked hillary clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" bernie said the same thing
how quality a woman is rowanne brewer lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud thank you rowanne
looks like yet another terrorist attack airplane departed from paris when will we get tough smart and vigilant great hate and sickness
my list of potential us supreme court justices was very well recieved during the next number of weeks i may be adding to the list
some low life journalist claims that i "made a pass" at her 29 years ago never happened like the @nytimes story which has become a joke
why did clinton supporter @alisonforky declare crooked hillary winner in ky when ap hasn't even called the race
bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the democrats the system is rigged against him many of his disenfranchised fans are for me
paul begala the dopey @cnn flunky and head of the pro hillary clinton super pac has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me
congratulations to the movement we have just won the great state of oregon the vote percentage is even higher than anticipated thank you
michael barbaro the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women has in past tweeted badly about me he should resign
i look so forward to debating crooked hillary clinton democrat primaries are rigged email investigation is rigged so time to get it on
i can't believe that @cnn would allow the very nice jeffrey lord to be savaged by a panel of seven trump haters 7 to 1 don't watch cnn
will go back on for a final question now
i like michael douglas
i will be live tweeting @megynkelly show in 10 minutes should be interesting will be on fox network enjoy
wall street paid for ad is a fraud just like crooked hillary their main line had nothing to do with women and they knew it apologize
do you think crooked hillary will finally close the deal if she can't win kentucky she should drop out of race system rigged
i look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight 8 pm et it will be interesting to see how she treats me i think she will be very fair
how can crooked hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for nafta the worst economic deal in us history
crooked hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economyif so he should runnot herwill he bring the "energizer" to dc
crooked hillary can't close the deal with bernie sanders will be another bad day for her
amazing that crooked hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the worst abuser of woman in us political history
oregon is voting today keep the big numbers going vote trump make america great again
crooked hillary clinton put out an ad where i am misquoted on women can't believe she would misrepresent the facts my hit was on china
the pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line "you can tell them to go blank themselves" was about china not women
wow 30000 emails were deleted by crooked hillary clinton she said they had to do with a wedding reception liar how can she run
what barbara res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back i said no
i gave a woman named barbara res a top ny construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty so much for a nice thank you
in politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue this is a primary reason that president obama is the worst president in us history
the writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes michael barbaro who was interviewed on cbs this morning was unable to respond
over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6 that’s because there were so many positive statements
no wonder the @nytimes is failing who can believe what they write after the false malicious and libelous story they did on me
the failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women
with the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud
a political commentator for @cnn which i no longer watch said "trump showed some weakness in the repub primaries" i set all time record
wow rowanne brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday was on @foxandfriends saying times lied
the @nytimes is so dishonest their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by rowanne brewer who said it was a lie
that was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends i hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is
bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the dems the system is rigged against him he should run as an independent run bernie run
the @washingtonpost report on potential vp candidates is wrong marco rubio and most others mentioned are not under consideration
the media is really on a witch hunt against me false reporting and plenty of it but we will prevail
why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that i was so proud to have helped with their careers dishonest
wow i have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece massive front page for that
why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the clintons and women the media is totally dishonest
everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and womeni gave them many names of women i helped refused to use
the failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me all are impressed with how nicely i have treated women they found nothing a joke
thank you for the nice words this morning @kellyriddell well delivered and totally logical @cnn @foxnews
wow @cnn is really working hard to make me look as bad as possible very unprofessional hurting in ratings bad television
if crooked hillary clinton can't close the deal on crazy bernie how is she going to take on china russia isis and all of the others
@thehill your story about me and the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect it is just the opposite i will not support or endorse a carbon tax
senator lindsey graham called me yesterday very much to my surprise and we had a very interesting talk about national security and more
if it were up to goofy elizabeth warren we’d have no jobs in america she doesn’t have a clue
in interview i told @ap that my taxes are under routine audit and i would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election
isn’t it funny when a failed senator like goofy elizabeth warren can spend a whole day tweeting about trump and gets nothing done in senate
goofy elizabeth warren lied when she says i want to abolish the federal minimum wage see media asking for increase
our native american senator goofy elizabeth warren couldn’t care less about the american worker…does nothing to help
goofy elizabeth warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked hillary see her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…”
if the people of massachusetts found out what an ineffective senator goofy elizabeth warren has been she would lose
goofy elizabeth warren didn’t have the guts to run for potus her phony native american heritage stops that and vp cold
goofy elizabeth warren has been one of the least effective senators in the entire us senate she has done nothing
i don't want to hit crazy bernie sanders too hard yet because i love watching what he is doing to crooked hillary his time will come
big wins in west virginia and nebraska get ready for november crooked hillary who is looking very bad against crazy bernie will lose
the clintons spend millions on negative ads on me and i can’t tell the truth about her husband don’t feel sorry for crooked hillary
it was so great being in nebraska last week today is the big day get out and vote
i look very much forward to meeting w/paul ryan and the gop party leadership on thurs in dc together we will beat the dems at all levels
it is only the people that were never asked to be vp that tell the press that they will not take the position
it was rosie o'donnell who ate the cake in the vicious hillary commercial about me not crooked hillary @marthamaccallum
why does the media with a strong push from crooked hillary keep pushing the false narrative that i want to raise taxes exactly opposite
 #repmikekelly great job on @foxandfriends this morning thank you for the nice words
get out and vote nebraska we will make america great again
get out and vote west virginia we will make america great again
i am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate any negotiated increase by congress to my proposal would still be lower than current
i will have set the all time record in primary votes in the republican party despite having to compete against 17 other people
if i only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like hillary clinton i would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did
crooked hillary clinton says that she got more primary votes than donald trump but i had 17 people to beat she had one
will be interviewed by @mariabartiromo on @foxbizalert at 730 am enjoy
wow i hear @morning_joe has gone really hostile ever since i said i won't do or watch the show anymorethey misrepresent my positions
i will be interviewed on @cnn at 700 am
@drmoore russell moore is truly a terrible representative of evangelicals and all of the good they stand for a nasty guy with no heart
remember when the two failed presidential candidates lindsey graham and jeb bush signed a binding pledge they broke the deal no honor
i am honored that the great men and women of the @teamsters have created a movement from within called teamsters for trump thank you
i am going to keep our jobs in the us and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure crooked hillary has no clue @teamsters
thank you to teachers across america when i become potus we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now
crooked hillary has zero leadership ability as bernie sanders says she has bad judgement constantly playing the women's card it is sad
paul ryan said that i inherited something very special the republican party wrong i didn't inherit it i won it with millions of voters
so many great endorsements yesterday except for paul ryan we must put america first and make america great again
governor rick perry said "donald trump is one of the most talented people running for the presidency i've ever seen" thank you rick
unlike crooked hillary clinton who wants to destroy all miners i want wages to go up in america we will do so by bringing back jobs
bernie sanders has been treated terribly by the democrats both with delegates and otherwise he should show them and run as an independent
i will be interviewed by @bretbaier @specialreport at 6pm et tonight @foxnews
many reports that i will be attending the alvarez/khan fight this weekend in vegas totally untrue unfortunately i have other plans
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 730 am enjoy
i will be interviewed on @todayshow and good morning america at 700 am
i will be interviewed on @morning_joe at 615 am enjoy
i would rather run against crooked hillary clinton than bernie sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against bernie
what a great evening we had so interesting that sanders beat crooked hillary the dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him
@oreillyfactor please correct i won virginia
thank you indiana we were just projected to be the winner we have won in every category you are very special people i will never forget
lyin' ted cruz consistently said that he will and must win indiana if he doesn't he should drop out of the race stop wasting time and money
wow lyin' ted cruz really went wacko today made all sorts of crazy charges can't function under pressure not very presidential sad
everybody is talking about the protesters burning the american flags and proudly waving mexican flags i want america first so do voters
gov mike pence has just stated that donald trump has taken a strong stance on hoosier jobs and he thanks me i will bring back jobs to usa
crooked hillary clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation" actually she has done poorly with such men
i will be interviewed on @cnn @newday at 730 am enjoy
i will be in indiana on sunday and monday at four make america great again rallies see you there
thank you @mikeozanian for the nice comments on @foxnews today great job
the economy is bad and getting worse almost zero growth this quarter nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs) make america great again
the "protesters" in california were thugs and criminals many are professionals they should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement
@ac360 anderson so amazing your mother is and always has been an incredible woman
we are now at 1001 delegates we will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged
crooked hillary clinton perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency is also one of the all time great enablers
wow the ridiculous deal made between lyin'ted cruz and 1 for 42 john kasich has just blown up what a dumb deal dead on arrival
so many false and phony tv commercials being broadcast in indiana reminds me of florida where thousands were put up i won in a landslide
i will be in evansville indiana with the great bobby knight (who last night endorsed me) at 1200 this afternoon see you there
lyin' ted cruz who can never beat hillary clinton and has no path to victory has chosen a vpcandidate who failed badly in her own effort
i will be interviewed on the @todayshow at 700 am this morning enjoy
thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech i will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics
getting the strong endorsement of the great coach bobby knight has been a highlight of my stay in indiana big speech tomorrow with bobby
i am in indiana where we just had a great rally fantastic people staying at a holiday inn express new and clean not bad
how bad is the new york times the most inaccurate coverage constantly always trying to belittle paper has lost its way
bernie sanders has been treated terribly by the democrats both with delegates and otherwise he should show them and run as an independent
the cruz kasich pact is under great strain this joke of a deal is falling apart not being honored and almost dead very dumb
on the way to the great state of rhode island big rally then to pennsylvania for rest of day and night
kasich just announced that he wants the people of indiana to vote for him typical politician can't make a deal work
shows how weak and desperate lyin' ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses
lyin' ted cruz and 1 for 38 kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one shows weakness
lyin' ted and kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate their donors and special interest groups are not happy with them sad
wow just announced that lyin' ted and kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the republican nomination desperation
i am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing it is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down becoming irrelevant
i will be in maryland this afternoon for a major rally things are looking good for tuesday
@andrebauer great job and advice on @cnn @jaketapper thank you
@borisep was great on @judgejeanine tonight very smart commentary that will prove to be correct
as soon as john kasich is hit with negative ads he will drop like a rock in the polls against crooked hillary clinton i will win
i had a great day campaigning in connecticut looking for a big vote on tuesday
congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @ap today amazing job
will be spending the day campaigning in connecticut another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries i will stop this fast
both ted cruz and john kasich have no path to victory they should both drop out of the race so that the republican party can unify
senator ted cruz has been mathematically eliminated from race he said kasich should get out for same reason i think both should get out
i will be doing the @todayshow with my wife melania and the rest of my family in a major town hall hopefully it will be fun enjoy7am
ted cruz is mathematically out of winning the race now all he can do is be a spoiler never a nice thing to do i will beat hillary
thank you new york i will never forget
@cnn is so negative it is impossible to watch terrible panel angry haters bill o @oreillyfactor said such an amazing thing about me
a big day for new york and for our country make america great again
i am on @foxandfriends at 700 am enjoy
lyin’ ted cruz even voted against superstorm sandy aid and september 11th help so many new yorkers devastated cruz hates new york
kasich only looks ok in polls against hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed zero negative ads against him
lyin' ted cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses i am millions of votes ahead hillary would destroy him and k
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 900 am i will be talking about the rigged and boss controlled republican primaries
big protest march in colorado on friday afternoon don't let the bosses take your vote
the rules did change in colorado shortly after i entered the race in june because the pols and their bosses knew i would win with the voters
biggest story in politics is now happening in the great state of colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting
great to be on @andersoncooper tonight with my wonderful family will be rebroadcast at 1200 am (eastern)
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 700 am enjoy
the people of colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians biggest story in politics this will not be allowed
how is it possible that the people of the great state of colorado never got to vote in the republican primary great anger totally unfair
i win a state in votes and then get non representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by cruz campaign bad system
the @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately i want other nations to pay the us for our defense of them we are the suckers no more
bernie sanders says that hillary clinton is unqualified to be president based on her decision making ability i can go along with that
isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else me still must fight
so great to be in new york catching up on many things (remember i am still running a major business while i campaign) and loving it
it is so great to be back home looking forward to a great rally tonight in bethpage long island
wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade but if i win all of the bad things happening in the us will be rapidly reversed
i will be in wisconsin until the election jobs trade and immigration will be big factors i will bring jobs back home make great deals
if @megynkelly stopped covering me on her show her ratings would drop like a rock my h to h interview with @ac360 beat her by millions
is it possible for @megynkelly to cover anyone but donald trump on her terrible show she totally misrepresents my words and positions bad
can you believe that ted cruz who has been killing our country on trade for so long just put out a wisconsin ad talking about trade
for the 1st time in american history america’s 16500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement me thank you
the national border patrol council (nbpc) said that our open border is the biggest physical and economic threat facing the american people
the club for growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (cruz) plus 143 delegates (kasich) is more than my 739 delegates try again
the club for growthwhich asked me for $1000000 in an extortion attempt just put up a wisconsin ad with incorrect mathwhat a dumb group
why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape
wow corey lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter look at tapes nothing there
how come the @todayshow and @chucktodd show the new @nbcnews poll for hillary vs bernie but do not show the same poll where i am killing cruz
i have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than cruz or kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the republican party or the rnc
wow @cnn has nothing but my opponents on their shows really one sided and unfair reporting maybe i shouldn't do their town hall tonight
we need to secure our borders asap no games we must be smart tough and vigilant make america great again and make america strong again
lyin' ted i have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates you should focus on jobs and illegal imm
lyin'ted cruz is weak and losing big so now he wants to debate again but according to drudgetime and on line polls i have won all debates
after the way i beat gov scott walker (and jeb rand marco and all others) in the presidential primaries no way he would ever endorse me
just released that international gangs are all over our cities this will end when i am president
ted cruz is incensed that i want to refocus nato on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to pay fair share a must
a detainee released from gitmo has killed an american when will our so called "leaders" ever learn
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 730 things are looking good had a great easter look forward to spending the week in wisconsin
the united states cannot continue to make such bad one sided trade deals there are only so many jobs we can give up no more
just to show you how unfair republican primary politics can be i won the state of louisiana and get less delegates than cruz lawsuit coming
why can't the pundits be honest hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again i will make it strong and great jobs
another radical islamic attack this time in pakistan targeting christian women and children at least 67 dead400 injured i alone can solve
happy easter to all have a great day
my statement on nato being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the us are now finally receiving plaudits
wow sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again he is do totally biased the things i am saying are correct far better vision than the others
i am interviewed on this week on @abc this morning enjoy
remember i am the only candidate who is self funding while i am given little credit for this by the voters i am not bought like others
don't believe the @foxnews polls they are just another phony hit job on me i will beat hillary clinton easily in the general election
wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in us jobs are leaving i will make our economy strong again bring in jobs
nobody will protect our nation like donald j trump our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong illegals out
lyin' ted cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with the national enqwere caused by me i had nothing to do with story
the press is going out of their way to convince people that i do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite
the media is so after me on women wow this is a tough business nobody has more respect for women than donald trump
top suspect in paris massacre salah abdeslam who also knew of the brussels attack is no longer talking weak leaders ridiculous laws
wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me how am i still number one by a lot
i didn't start the fight with lyin'ted cruz over the gq cover pic of melania he did he knew the pac was putting it out hence lyin' ted
just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the trump u case but the press refuses to write about it if i lost monster story
europe and the us must immediately stop taking in people from syria this will be the destruction of civilization as we know it so sad
just announced that as many as 5000 isis fighters have infiltrated europe also many in us i told you so i alone can fix this problem
explain how the women on the view which is a total disaster since the great barbara walters left ever got their jobs @abc is wasting time
@theview tv show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on i tell them "no"
hillary clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years time for a change i will solve and fast
it is amazing how often i am right only to be criticized by the media illegal immigration take the oil build the wall muslims nato
remember when i recently said that brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article i was so right
@lindseygrahamsc and lyin' ted cruz are two politicians who are very much alike all talk and no action both talk about isis do nothing
it is amazing how @lindseygrahamsc gets on so many tv shows talking negatively about me when i beat him so badly (zero) in his pres run
we pay a disproportionate share of the cost of nato why it is time to renegotiate and the time is now
nato is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on
make america great again
i want to thank @realsheriffjoe for all of his help in our historic arizona win could not have done it without you joe
while i believe i will clinch before cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race
i think having jeb's endorsement hurts lyin' ted jeb spent more than $150000000 and got nothing i spent a fraction of that and am first
i will be the best by far in fighting terror i’m the only one that was right from the beginning and now lyin’ ted and others are copying me
just watched hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror she’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years and look where we are
low energy jeb bush just endorsed a man he truly hates lyin’ ted cruz honestly i can’t blame jeb in that i drove him into oblivion
lyin’ ted cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from michael douglas  just another dishonest politician
lyin' ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the gq model photo post of melania that's why we call him lyin' ted
hopefully the republican party can come together and have a big win in november paving the way for many great supreme court justices
much bigger win than anticipated in arizona thank you i will never forget
incompetent hillary despite the horrible attack in brussels today wants borders to be weak and open and let the muslims flow in no way
lyin' ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a gq shoot in his ad be careful lyin' ted or i will spill the beans on your wife
obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger shame
i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody and it’s not even close hopefully az and ut will be voting for me today
make america great again
president obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in cuba especially in the shadows of brussels he is being treated badly
wow president obama just landed in cuba a big deal and raul castro wasn't even there to greet him he greeted pope and others no respect
big republican dinner tonight at mar a lago in palm beach i will be there
so the highly overrated anchor @megynkelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but i can't fight back wrong
the protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my rally in arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters
why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roads/doors during my rallies are never blamed by media sad
will be interviewed on @thisweekabc this morning enjoy
the rallies in utah and arizona were great tremendous crowds and spirit just returned but will be going back soon
if crazy @megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show her ratings would totally tank she is so average in so many ways
crazy @megynkelly says i don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings but almost all of her shows are negative hits on me
failed presidential candidate mitt romney the man who "choked" and let us all down is now endorsing lyin' ted cruz this is good for me
going to salt lake city utah for a big rally lyin' ted cruz should not be allowed to win there mormons don't like liars i beat hillary
club for growth tried to extort $1000000 from me when i said no they went hostile with negative ads disgraceful
with millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up can anyone explain this
@ewerickson got fired like a dog from redstateand now he is the one leading opposition against me
senator @lindseygrahamsc made horrible statements about @sentedcruz – and then he endorsed him no wonder nobody trusts politicians
lyin' ted cruz lost all five races on tuesday and he was just given the jinx a lindsey graham endorsement also backed jeb lindsey got 0
hillary clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life
make america great again
highly overrated and crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about trump and yet she devotes her shows to me focus on others megyn
looking like my 5 victories on tuesday will be just as good as if i won ohio two more days and ohio was mine
please explain to the dummies at the @wsj editorial board that i love to debate and have won according to drudge etc all 11 of them
@wsj is bad at math the good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me
@wsj editorial says "clinton primary vote total is 8646551trump's is 7533692" a knock but she had only 3 opponents i had 16apologize
the reason lyin' ted cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars a big problem
crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me yet her bad show is a total hit piece on metough
great news that @foxnews has cancelled the additional debate how many times can the same people ask the same question i beat cruz debating
crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' ted cruz on her show last night ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse ted can't win
stuart stevens the failed campaign manager of mitt romney's historic loss is now telling the republican party what to do with trump sad
i will be interviewed on the o'reilly factor this evening at 8 pm on the fox news channel @oreillyfactor
wow just won missouri
i am making a big speech the night of the @foxnews debate but i wish everyone well yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins
in the last 2 weeks i had $35m of negative ads against me in florida and i won in a massive landslidethe establishment should save their $$
yesterday was amazing 5 victories lyin’ ted cruzhad zero things are going very well
@reptommarino great job on television this morning glad to have you on my side
watching other networks and local news really good night crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable
can't watch crazy megyn anymore talks about me at 43 percent but never mentions that there are four people in race with two people big and over
word is that despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads i had a massive victory in florida numbers out soon
a lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in florida hope this is false
i will bring our jobs back to the us and keep our companies from leaving nobody else can do it our economy will "sing" again
in presidential voting so far john kasich is zero for 22 so why would he be a good candidate hillary would beat him i will beat hillary
ohio is losing jobs to mexico now losing ford (and many others) kasich is weak on illegal immigration we need strong borders now
watching john kasich being interviewed acting so innocent and like such a nice guy remember him in second debate until i put him down
north carolina lost 300000 manufacturing jobs and ohio lost 400000 since 2000 going to mexico etc no more if i win we will bring back
don't reward mitt romney who let us all down in the last presidential race by voting for kasich (who voted for nafta open borders etc)
please remember i am the only candidate who is self funding his campaign kasich rubio and cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists
i will bring our jobs back to america fix our military and take care of our vets end common core and obamacare protect 2nd a build wall
rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the us senate in many years he will never make america great again
kasich voted for nafta a disaster for ohio and now wants the even worse tpp approved vote trump and end this madness
the failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers they knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check really bad people
govkasich of ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the @golfchannel
ohio govkasich voted for nafta from which ohio has never recovered now he wants tpp which will be even worse ohio steel and coal dying
bernie sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events be careful bernie or my supporters will go to yours
do the people of ohio know that john kasich is strongly in favor of common core in other words education of your children from dc no way
the last person that hillary or bernie want to run against is donald trump  and that is fact
make america great again
on my way to dayton ohio will be there soon
the rally in cincinnati is on media put out false reports that it was cancelled will be great love you ohio
ohio had the biggest budget increase in the us if it were not for striking oil they would be bust governor kasich in favor of tpp fraud
absentee governor kasich voted for nafta and nafta devastated ohio a disaster from which it never recovered kasich is good for mexico
the organized group of people many of them thugs who shut down our first amendment rights in chicago have totally energized america
rumor has it that @politico is going out of business losing too much money great news likewise dopey mort zuckerman's @nydailynews
wow you are all correct about @foxnews totally biased and disgusting reporting
word is i am doing very well in michigan and mississippi wow and with all that money spent against me will be going to trump jupiter now
i hear @nbcnews / @wsj came out with another one of their phony polls while i am leading they are totally discredited after last sc poll
the negative television commercials about me paid for by the politicians bosses are a total #mediafraud when you watch remember
mitt romney had his chance and blew it lindsey graham ran for president got zero and quit why are they now spokesmen against me sad
remember i am the only one who is self funding my campaign all of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests
sun sentinel says rubio lacks the experience work ethic and gravitas needed to be president he has not earned your vote
make america great again
it was great being in michigan remember i am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the usand protect car industry
don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight rubio and the r establishment dishonest people
leaving for north carolina big crowd will be fun
congratulation to adam scott and all of the folks at trump national doral on producing a really great wgc tournament amazing finish
i will be using facebook and twitter to expose dishonest lightweight senator marco rubio a record no show in senate he is scamming florida
we cannot let the failing republican establishment who could not stop obama (twice) ruin the movement with millions of $'s in false ads
lindsey graham is all over tv much like failed 47 percent candidate mitt romney these nasty angry jealous failures have zero credibility
failed presidential candidate lindsey graham should respect me i destroyed his run brought him from 7 percent to 0 percent when he got out now nasty
how do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians i will be using facebook and twitter watch
all of the phony tv commercials against me are bought and payed for by special interest groups the bandits that tell your pols what to do
i am at trump national doral best resort in us rory and adam scott are doing great watch on nbc at 300 pm make america great again
i will be interviewed on @facethenation this morning enjoy @jdickerson
@foxnews is devastated that lightweight senator marco rubio got trounced tonight and is the big loser i won the two big states great
will be in orlando florida this afternoon 25000 people expected this is a movement like our great country has never seen before
wow big lines in kansas
for all of today's voters please remember that i am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign i am not bought and paid for
great time last night in louisiana big and energetic crowd go out and vote now polls open make america great again
i am in kansas will be an exciting day big speech this morning in wichita and then go to caucus sorry cpac (the format was fine)
the phony lawsuit against trump u could have been easily settled by me but i want to go to court 98 percent approval rating by students easy win
why did mitt romney beg me for my endorsement four years ago
i am the only one who can beat hillary clinton i am not a mitt romney who doesn't know how to win hillary wants no part of "trump"
why would the great people of florida vote for a guy who as a senator never even shows up to vote worst record marco rubio is a joke
i have brought millions of people into the republican party while the dems are going down establishment wants to kill this movement
failed candidate mitt romneywho ran one of the worst races in presidential historyis working with the establishment to bury a big "r" win
looks like two time failed candidate mitt romney is going to be telling republicans how to get elected not a good messenger
millions of dollars being spent on false tv ads by special interest groups who own rubio and cruzwhen you see them think of your puppet pols
because of me the republican party has taken in millions of new voters a record if they are not careful they will all leave sad
why can't the leaders of the republican party see that i am bringing in new voters by the millions we are creating a larger stronger party
marco rubio lost big last night i even beat him in virginia where he spent so much time and money now his bosses are desperate and angry
why would anyone in florida vote for lightweight senator marco rubio check out his credit card scam his house sale and his no show voting
the special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent tv ads on me
got the endorsement of brian france and @nascar yesterday in georgia also many of the sports great drivers thank you nascar and georgia
my sons don and eric are on @foxandfriends now 735 great kids enjoy
lightweight senator marco rubio is polling very poorly in florida the people can't stand him for missing so many votes poor work ethic
mitt romney didn't show his tax return until september 21 2012 and then only after being humiliated by harry r a bad messenger for estab
why would the people of texas support ted cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them he is another all talk no action pol
little marco rubio the lightweight no show senator from florida is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest koch brothers watch
making a big speech in alabama today so many people we had to move to a football stadium come and join us
i am the only republican who will get large numbers of dems and indies (crossover) i will also get states that no other republican can get
while hillary and i both won south carolina by big margins repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cyclesgrowing party
the republican establishment has been pushing for lightweight senator marco rubio to say anything to "hit" trumpi signed the pledge careful
while i hear the koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil) word is they have chosen little marco rubio the lightweight from florida
just watched lightweight marco rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record he is not as smart as cruz and may be an even bigger liar
#rogerstone was just banned by @cnn their loss tough loyal guy
i started my business with very little and built it into a great company with some of the best real estate assets in the world amazing
i only wish my wonderful father fred gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight rubio says he didn't total fabrication
fun to watch the democrats working so hard to win the great state of south carolina when i just won the republican version amazing people
i am self funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight rubio or ted cruz
tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit after the audit no problem
i unfairly get audited by the irs almost every single year i have rich friends who never get audited i wonder why
i will be on @foxandfriends at 830 am will be talking about lightweight marco rubio and lying ted cruz
will be at fort worth (texas) convention center at 1130 am big crowd get there early big announcement to be made
why would the people of florida vote for marco rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their senator and then quit
have a good chance to win texas on tuesday cruz is a nasty guy not one senate endorsement and despite talk gets nothing done loser
i will be making a speech at 1200 in fort worth texas really big crowd expected will be talking about the debate last night plus plus
fmr pres of mexico vicente fox horribly used the f word when discussing the wall he must apologize if i did that there would be a uproar
why doesn’t @mittromney just endorse @marcorubio alreadyshould have done it before nh or nevada where he had a little sway too latenow
mitt romney who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of republican politics is now pushing me on tax returns dope
@repchriscollins chris thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement i will not let you down @cnn
when ted cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear i will get most of his votes no problem
why would texans vote for "liar" ted cruz when he was born in canada lived there for 4 years and remained a canadian citizen until recently
when mitt romney asked me for my endorsement last time around he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win
mitt romneywho totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool is now playing tough guy
the polls show that i picked up many jeb bush supporters that is how i got to 46 percent when others drop out i will pick up more sad but true
@usatoday poll and @quinnipiacpoll say that i beat both hillary and bernie and i havn't even started on them yet
big defeat last night in nevada for ted cruz and marco rubio @karlrove on @foxnews is working hard to belittle my victory rove is sick
@melaniatrump did great on television this morning poised smart and strong with a big heart so much to offer we are all proud of you
melania will be interviewed by @morningmika on @morning_joe now (830 am) enjoy

unlike the other republican candidates i will be in nevada all day and night i won't be fleeing in and out i love and invest in nevada
i am growing the republican party tremendously just look at the numbers way up democrats numbers are significantly down from years past
ted cruz lifts the bible high into the air and then lies like a dog over and over again the evangelicals in sc figured him out and said no
ted cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be president look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm bad
wow was ted cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication he used him as a scape goat fired like a dog ted panicked
ted cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in sc he is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration
ted cruz said on @oreillyfactor that illegals sent out of country by my administration would come right back as citizens another lie crazy
a big fat hit job on @oreillyfactor tonight a total waste of time to watch boring and biased @brithume said i would never run a dope
great town hall tonight at 1000 pm (eastern) conducted by @seanhannity on @foxnews
just watched the very incompetent mitt romney campaign strategist stuart stevens now i know why mitt lost so badly stevens is a clown
ted cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in iowa weak rnc and republican leadership probably won't let this happen sad
just saw the phony ad by cruz totally false more dirty tricks he got caught in so many lies is this man crazy
ted cruz has now apologized to marco rubio and ben carson for fraud and dirty tricks no wonder he has lost evangelical support
ted cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false no basis in fact take ad down ted biggest liar in politics
wow ted cruz falsely suggested marco rubio mocked the bible and was just forced to fire his communications director more dirty tricks
it is so important to audit the federal reserve and yet ted cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done
many people are now saying i won south carolina because of the last debate i showed anger and the people of our country are very angry
the reason that ted cruz lost the evangelicals in sc is because he is a world class liar and evangelicals do not like liars
i am in las vegas at the best hotel (by far) trump international i will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to win nevada
a number of months ago i was not expected to win south carolinated cruz was and yet i won in a landslide every group and category win
the failing @wsj wall street journal should fire both its pollster and its editorial board seldom has a paper been so wrongtotally biased
i will be live on all of the major morning talk shows enjoy
thank you @sarahpalinusa for your amazing help and support big win leaving now for atlanta and nevadathe people of south carolina got it
what a great night thank you south carolina a special place with truly amazing people love
people (pundits) gave me no chance in south carolina now it looks like a possible win i would be happy with a one vote victory (hope)
south carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands vote now (today) and make america great again
remember that marco rubio is very weak on illegal immigration south carolina needs strength as illegals and syrians pour in don't allow it
i wonder if president obama would have attended the funeral of justice scalia if it were held in a mosque very sad that he did not go
i am the only candidate (in many years) who is self funding his campaign lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates
lying #ted cruz just (on election day) came out with a sneak and sleazy robocall he holds up the bible but in fact is a true lowlife pol
make america great again
just finished two major speeches in south carolina big crowds great people going for a third now
boycott all apple products until such time as apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical islamic terrorist couple from cal
hopefully others will follow suit our country needs and should demand security it is time to get tough and be smart
i use both iphone and samsung if apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists i'll only be using samsung until they give info
i agree with marco rubio that ted cruz is a liar
@foxnews is changing their theme from "fair and balanced" to "unfair and unbalanced" but dying @wsj is worsetheir phony poll is a joke
new cbs national poll just out massive lead for trump the wall street journal/nbc poll is a total joke no wonder wsj is doing so badly
i love being in south carolina we are leading big in all of the state polls saturday is a big day make america great again
the just out usa today national poll where i lead by big numbers shows that in a head to head matchup i beat both hillary and bernie
amazing that while i lead by big numbers in the new q and and usa today polls the the press only wants to report on the phony wsj/nbc poll
@foxnews is so biased it is disgusting they do not want trump to win all negative
interesting how president obama so haltingly said i "would never be president" this from perhaps the worst president in us history
why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative without me her ratings would tank get a life megyn
thank you @kayleighmcenany for your nice words great knowledge and style we are doing really well in south carolina @cnn @donlemon
@brithume thinks that when republicans drop out of the race someone will pick up all of that vote the fact is i will get much of it
explain to @brithume and @megynkelly who know nothing that i will beat hillary and win states (and dem indie votes) that no other r can
new ppp poll just out trump up big cruz rubio and bush down the debate results even with a stacked rnc audience were wonderful
spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in south carolina great people and spirit today will be more of the same
now that george bush is campaigning for jeb() is he fair game for questions about world trade center iraq war and eco collapse careful
i will be in south carolina all week saturday is big big big get out and vote make america great again
jeb bush and ted cruz are not electable presidential candidates hillary would destroy them ted may not be eligible to run born in canada
funny that jeb() didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last namethen mommy now brother
ted cruz along with jeb bush pushed justice john roberts onto the supreme court roberts could have killed obamacare twice but didn't
wow in the new cbs poll i went way up into the forties thank you
tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists and special interests the bosses
loved the debate last night and almost everyone said i won but the rnc did a terrible job of ticket distrbution all donors and special ints
even though every poll time drudge etc has me winning the debate by a lot @foxnews only puts negative people on biased a total joke
a very big thank you to bill donohue head of the catholic league for the wonderful interview on @cnn and article in newsmax great insight
just got back from tampa it was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd fantastic people will be in south carolina tomorrow
millions of $'s of false ads paid for by lobbyists special interests of cheater @sentedcruz and sleepy @jebbush are now running in sc
last time lightweight @jebbush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself if he doesn't do better this time he is out
lightweight @jebbush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in sc false advertising desperate and sad
the failing @nydailynews destroyed by little morty zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online it's dead
we are getting reports from many voters that the cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me we are watching
jeb failed as jeb he gave up and enlisted mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of iraq) spent $120 millionweak no chance
he (or she) who hesitates is lost make america great again
remember it was the republican party with the help of conservatives that made so many promises to their base but didn't keep them hi dt
@markhalperin showed a focus group on @morning_joe me using a very bad word i never said the word left an open blank please apologize
jeb bush spent more than $40000000 in new hampshire to come in 4 or 5 i spent $3000000 to come in 1st big difference in capability
there are no buyers for the worthless @nydailynews but little mort zuckerman is frantically looking it is bleeding red ink a total loser
such a great experience in new hampshire amazing people will be leaving for a big event in south carolina today
new hampshire vote today make america great again
make america great again
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 840 am enjoy
the polls are now showing that i am the best to win the general election states that are never in play for repubs will be won by me great
no one has done more for people with disabilities than me i have spent many millions of dollars to help out and am happy to have done so
i know the "governors" and jeb bush who has gone nasty with lies is by far the weakest of the lot his family used private eminent domain
remember @jebbush wants common core (education from dc) and is very weak on illegal immigration ("come as act of love") not a leader
jeb bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a super bowl ad he is a weak candidate
my two wonderful sons don and eric will be on @foxandfriends at 702 now enjoy
so far the super bowl is very boring not nearly as exciting as politics make america great again
i love new hampshire will be an exciting evening
wow jeb bush whose campaign is a total disaster had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me not nice
such great support in new hampshire so many people are working so hard to #makeamericagreatagain
i very much look forward to tomorrow’s debate in new hampshire so many things to say so much at stake it will be an incredible evening
big storm in new hampshire moved my event to monday will be there next four days
watch @ac360 on now @cnn
sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me he would be so easy to beat
i will be interviewed on @greta at 700 pm enjoy @foxnews
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified
and finally cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and "choice" a total lie
the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of f) and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz fraud
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud also cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters
during primetime of the iowa caucus cruz put out a release that @realbencarson was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for cruz
ted cruz didn't win iowa he stole it that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated bad
great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job we said no and she went hostile a real dummy @cnn
anybody who watched all of ted cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his howard dean moment
@restorereality iowa is meaninglesskeep pushing forward run the table in nh sc nv and super tuesday america needs you #trumptrain
@morning_joe @mikebarnicle on @realdonaldtrump he finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro"
i don't believe i have been given any credit by the voters for self funding my campaign the only one i will keep doing but not worth it
i will be talking about my wonderful experience in iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media later in new hampshire big crowd
the media has not covered my long shot great finish in iowa fairly brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history
because i was told i could not do well in iowa i spent very little there a fraction of cruz and rubio came in a strong second great honor
my experience in iowa was a great one i started out with all of the experts saying i couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place nice
it all begins today we will finally take our country back and make america great again
i will be interviewed on face the nation with @jdickerson this morning enjoy
i am in iowa will be interviewed on this week with @gstephanopoulos this morning enjoy
if i would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings received) also vets got $6000000
by not doing the failed poorly rated debate i was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" while raising $6000000 for vets
wow just saw an ad cruz is lying on so many levels there is nobody more against obamacare than me will repeal and replace he lies
ted cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important financial disclosure form very low interest loans scam
ted cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in canada) will loose big to hillary polls show i beat hillary easily win
i will be going to church in iowa this morning with my wife melania after church i will be making two speeches and touring the state
@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man when i wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more he endorsed cruz @foxandfriends
@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event the people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100000 for himself phony @foxandfriends
@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy asked me for expensive hotel rooms free (and more) i said pay and he endorsed cruz
the cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation" they are now under investigation bad
i will be in iowa all day and until tuesday morning finally after all these years of watching stupidity we will make america great again
hillary clinton is a major national security risk not presidential material
@oreillyfactor the people of iowa love the fact that i stuck up for my rights as i will do for the us also got $6000000 for our vets
@foxnews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night $6000000 raised in one hour for our vets
amazing that ted cruz can't even get a senator like @bensasse who is easy to endorse him not one senator is endorsing canada ted
@bensasse looks more like a gym rat than a us senator how the hell did he ever get elected @greta
the great state of nebraska can do much better than @bensasse as your senator saw him on @greta totally ineffective wants paid for pols
the new email release is a disaster for hillary clinton at a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president
getting ready to take off for nashua new hampshire big crowd will be there soon fun
iowa was amazing last night the event could not have worked out better we raised $6000000 for our great vets they were so happy and proud
i hear that @sentedcruz’s $$ man robert mercer a good man is very angry because cruz lied to him about liquidating his (ted’s) holdings
the "debate" tonight will be a total disaster low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock i hate to see this
wow two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event tonight at drake university
i will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 800 pm (eastern) enjoy
even though i beat him in the first six debates especially the last one ted cruz wants to debate me again can we do it in canada
just got to listen to rush limbaugh the guy is fantastic
the statement put out yesterday by @foxnews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism who would ever say something so nasty and dumb
do you think @sentedcruz knows about @bobvanderplaats dealings actually i doubt it
@bobvanderplaats begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100000 for himself a bad guy
why doesn't phony @bobvanderplaats tell his followers all the times he asked for him and his family to stay at my hotels didn't like paying
i will be interviewed by @mariabartiromo on @morningsmaria @foxbusiness at 730 am enjoy
i will be doing @gma @gstephanopoulos this morning at around 700 likewise i will be doing @morning_joe at around 700 figure it out
i will be on morning's with maria on the fox business network tomorrow during the 7am and 8am et hours
i will be on the situation room with @wolfblitzer from 5 7pm est on cnn
it's time for ted cruz to either settle his problem with the fact that he was born in canada and was a citizen of canada or get out of race
i will be on face the nation this morning at various times across the us @cbsnews enjoy
i will be on @meetthepress this morning at various times across the us @nbcnews enjoy
heading to sioux county iowa where the crowd is amazing dr robert jeffress will make the introduction make america great again
ted cruz poll numbers are down big because he was born in canada and was until recently a canadian citizen many believe he cannot run
i am in iowa watching all of these phony tv ads by the other candidates all bull politicians are all talk and no action it won't happen
@anncoulter has been amazing we will win and establish strong borders we will build a wall and mexico will pay we will be great again
i am in iowa will be making two speeches today good luck to all of the great folks on the east coast enjoy the beauty of the storm
wow new national zogby poll just outtrump 45 cruz 13 rubio 8 big numbers
leaving nevada now for iowa things are looking good great new polls
the dying @nro national review has totally given up the fight against barrack obama they have been losing for years i will beat hillary
after spending $89 million @jebbush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls he is ashamed to use the name "bush" in ads low energy guy
the failing @nro national review magazine has just been informed by the republican national committee that they cannot participate in debate
highly respected constitutional law professor mary brigid mcmanamon has just stated "ted cruz is not eligible to be president" big problem
ted cruz complains about my views on eminent domain but without it we wouldn't have roads highways airports schools or even pipelines
happy birthday to my friend the great @jacknicklaus a totally special guy
low energy candidate @jebbush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign millions spent on me he should go home and relax
sad sack @jebbush has just done another ad on me with special interest money saying i won't beat hillary i will but he can't beat me
so sad that @cnn and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in oklahoma dishonest reporting
wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @sarahpalinusa endorsement that cruz so desperately wanted glenn is a failing crying lost soul
wow the highly respected governor of iowa just stated that "ted cruz must be defeated" big shoker people do not like ted
wow new polls just out have trump up and cruz down he is a nervous wreck
i don't think ted cruz can even run for president until he can assure republican voters that being born in canada is not a problem doubt
ted cruz is falling in the polls he is nervous people are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks
i am self funding my campaign putting up my own money not controlled cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his ny bosses
far more killed than anticipated in radical islamic terror attack yesterday get tough and smart us or we won't have a country anymore
iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving thembut they won't buy from us rather airbus
in iran deal we get 4 prisoners they get $150 billion 7 most wanted and many off watch list this will create great incentive for others
ted cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks they own him
based on the fact that ted cruz was born in canada and is therefore a "natural born canadian" did he borrow unreported loans from c banks
oh no just reported that ted cruz didn't report another loan this one from citi wow no wonder banks do so well in the us senate
the ted cruz wiseguy apology to the people of new york is a disgrace remember his wife's employer and his lender is located there
was there another loan that ted cruz forgot to file goldman sachs owns him he will do anything they demand not much of a reformer
ted cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a canadian citizen he also forgot to file his goldman sachs million $ loan papersnot believable
ted cruz was born in canada and was a canadian citizen until 15 months ago lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow i told you so
more radical islam attacks today it never ends strengthen the borders we must be vigilant and smart no more being politically correct
@frankluntz is a total clown has zero credibility @foxnews @megynkelly
@oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing @glennbeck that i supported john mccain big league in 2008 not obama
just got back from iowa had a great time with amazing people will be back soon
@geraldorivera thank you geraldo for your nice words on @oreillyfactor tonight you are a true champion thank @ericbolling great guy
do you think iran would have acted so tough if they were russian sailors our country was humiliated
sadly there is no way that ted cruz can continue running in the republican primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility dems will sue
iran toys with us days before we pay them ridiculously billions of dollars don't release money we want our hostages back now
numerous polls have me beating hillary clinton in a race with her voter turnout will be the highest in us history i get most new voters
the state of the union speech was one of the most boring rambling and non substantive i have heard in a long time new leadership fast
on my way to cedar falls iowa now will be great i love the people of iowa
the tonight show begins in 5 minutes enjoy
@stuartpstevens horrible advise to mitt romney made victory an impossibility don't blame mitt now stevens can't get a job
fantastic job on @cnn tonight @kayleighmcenany is a winner @donlemon
don't forget to watch the tonight show with the wonderful @jimmyfallon at 1130 pm you will not be disappointed @nbc
face the nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years congratulations and wow @cbsnews @jdickerson
@majorcbs major garrett of @cbsnews covers me very inaccurately total agenda bad reporter
thank you michael harrison @talkersmagazine for your kind words greatly appreciated
@megynkelly recently said that she can’t be wooed by trump she is so average in every way who the hell wants to woo her
heading now for reno nevada for a big rally good poll numberd all over
in the just out @foxnews poll i easily beat hillary clinton and i havn't even focused on her yet on our way make america great again
yesterday in iowa was amazing two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds they love that i am the only candidate self funding
constitutional law expert #laurence tribe of harvard says "wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter it isn't settled)
south carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun) i am now off to iowa for two big rallies packed houses love it
pat buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @cnn way to go pat way ahead of your time
will be at venue in wonderful south carolina very soon big traffic back up tremendous crowd will be wild
hank greenberg formerly of aig gave $10 million to the @jebbush campaign 3 months ago he is not happy a total waste of money
i don’t know @samuelljackson to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him and think he does too many tv commercials boring not a fan
wow @unionleader circulation in nh has dropped from 75000 to around 10 bad management no wonder they begged me for ads
iran with all of the money and all else given to them by obama has wanted a way to take over saudi arabia and their oil they just found it
does anybody remember when bill clinton in 2008 worked long and hard for hillary she lost now bill is at it again just watch
hillary said that guns don't keep you safe if she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm
al shabbab not isis just made a video on me they all will as front runner and if i speak out against them which i must hillary lied
hillary clinton lied last week when she said isis made a dt video the video that isis made was about her husband being a degenerate
just returned from mississippi a great evening
just arrived in mississippi for the rally word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive will be an amazing evening
remember i am self funding my campaign the only one in either party i'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests only the usa
when i look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates beware the candidates are mere puppets $$$$
i hope bill clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how hillary abused those women
hillary clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president jeb bush is a low energy individual but hillary is not much better
hillary clinton said that it is ok to ban muslims from israel by building a wall but not ok to do so in the us we must be vigilant
@jebbush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls has no chance
@jebbush is a sad case a total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on trump hit ads
the person that hillary clinton least wants to run against is by far me it will be the largest voter turnout ever she will be swamped
i will be going to mississippi tomorrow night hear the crowds are going to be massive look forward to it
well the year has officially begun i have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around
i will be on @foxnews live with members of my family at 1150 pm we will ring in the new year together make america great again
i would like to wish everyone a happy and healthy new year we must all work together to finally make america safe again and great again
do you believe that the state department on new year's eve just released more of hillary's emails they just want it all to end bad
i would feel sorry for @jebbush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me
people ask "why do you tweet and re tweet to millions about @jebbush when he is so low in the polls" because of his big $ hit ads on me
@jebbush has spent $63000000 and is at the bottom of the polls i have spent almost nothing and am at the top win @hughhewitt
a great day in south carolina record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm this is now a movement to make america great again
i predict that dying @unionleader newspaper which has been run into the ground by publisher "stinky" joe mcquaid will be dead in 2 years
i never thought i'd be saying this but i've really enjoyed @richlowry on television lately and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity
iowa was fantastic last night amazing crowd and people i'm now in florida getting ready to go to south carolina big crowd very exciting
@charleshurt you were great on @seanhannity last night thanks for the nice words make america great again
looking forward to being in council bluffs iowa later today despite weather rally is on will be fantastic #makeamericagreatagain
so i have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place jeb bush has spent $59 million and done run country my way
my campaign for president is $35000000 under budget i have spent very little (and am in 1st place)now i will spend big in iowa/nh/sc
@jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @foxnews he really gets it
remember that bill clinton was brought in to help hillary against obama in 2008 he was terrible failed badly and was called a racist
strange but i see wacko bernie sanders allies coming over to me because i'm lowering taxes while he will double and triple them a disaster
wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few and people have lost faith in our leaderswe need smart and strong leadership now
many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries we now are part time sad i will fix
the middle class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of and no effective raise in years bad
if hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong
hopefully the republican national committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in virginia's republican party fast
straighten out the republican party of virginia before it is too late stupid rnc
@berniesanders who blew his campaign when he gave hillary a pass on her email crime said that i feel wages in america are too high lie
the voters the republican party of virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory the dems love it be smart and win for a change
rpvirginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row will now not allow desperately needed new voters suicidal mistake rnc must act now
it begins republican party of virginia controlled by the rnc is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters bad
i will do far more for women than hillary and i will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do no strength/stamina
hillary clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but he's demonstrated a penchant for sexism so inappropriate
our great veterans are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the va that will stop i will fix this quickly
remember when failed candidate @jebbush said that illegals came across the border as an act of love he's spent $59 million and is at 3 percent
we have many problems in our house (country) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay make america great again
does everyone see that the democrats and president obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally politics
@deedeesorvino was great today on @foxnews she gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly have her on more
merry christmas to all have a great day and have a really amazing year together we will make america great again it will be done
@danielhalper great job on @cnn today very wise indeed
@halliejackson why didn't you report hillary lying about the isis video bad reporting perhaps @nbc will do better next year but doubt it
i am now in palm beach florida and will be going to church tonight make america great again
@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @cnn poll where i am at 39 percent 21points higher than cruz be honest chuck
why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @cnn poll when discussing how well i am doing instead of the older q poll cnn even better
wow because of the pressure put on by me ice to launch large scale deportation raids it's about time
next year will be an interesting one i look forward to running against hillary clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly
third rate reporters amy chozick and maggie haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the hillary circle of bias think about bill
wow even lowly rand paul has just past @jebbush in the new @cnn poll jeb is at 3 percent i'm at 39 percent stop throwing your money down the drain
in the ridiculous @jebbush ad about me jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him so sad
poor @jebbush spent $50 million on his campaign i spent almost nothing he's bottom (and gone) i'm top (by a lot) that's what us needs
hillary said "i really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign" i deplore the death and destruction she caused stupidity
hillary when you complain about "a penchant for sexism" who are you referring to i have great respect for women be careful
it is hard to believe i am winning by so much when i am treated so badly by the media new @cnn poll amazing in all categories 21 pt lead
why does @foxnews give @karlrove so much airtime he (and other fox pundits) is so biased still thinks romney won unfair coverage of trump
@foxnews treats me so badly using old quinnipiac poll where i have a much smaller lead than the just out @cnn poll all negative
the @washingtonpost which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #amazon today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids bad
the hillary clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic be careful hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card
big news just out new @cnn poll trump 39 and leads in every major category likeability way up cruz 18 carson 10 rubio 10
we need a president with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again
it is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong sad
when i said that hillary clinton got schlonged by obama it meant got beaten badly the media knows this often used word in politics
wow new reuters poll just out big lead if you want to make america great again trump 37 cruz 11 this is at the top of drudge
jeb's big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn't have me answering jeb's statements he is really pathetic
watching @cnn and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television boring and biased
@jebbush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible fumbled around incoherent
why doesn't @jebbush in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate
will @jebbush in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate
@jebbush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy will never work
weak and low energy @jebbush whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy
getting ready to leave for michigan will be an amazing evening see you there
do you think that hillary clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about "the video" of me being used by isis there is no video
thanks @andreatantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts big progress is being made keep up the great work
a suicide bomber has just killed us troops in afghanistan when will our leaders get tough and smart we are being led to slaughter
it's the democrats' total weakness and incompetence that gave rise to isis  not a tape of donald trump that was an admitted hillary lie
getting ready to go to the great state of michigan big crowd tonight make america great again
just out trump gop debate 18000000 clinton democrat debate 6700000 and they were on major network vs cable
hillary said with respect to isis "we are finally where we need to be" do we want 4 more years of incompetent leadership maga
i demand an apology from hillary clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate there never was a video
hillary said at debate isis is "going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst" she made up story want apology
very sad what happened last night at the miss universe pageant i sold it 6 months ago for a record price this would never have happened
@missuniverse final 3 on now great people great new owner @img watch
it was really strange when hillary was missing from the podium last night not very presidential
hillary clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no isis video of me therefore hillary lied at the debate last night sad
@jebbush was terrible on face the nation today being at 2 percent and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence a basket case
hillary clinton lied when she said that "isis is using video of donald trump as a recruiting tool" this was fact checked by @foxnews false
@gstephanopoulos stupidly believes that hillary wants to run against me because she said so she says that so people believe it opposite
president obama spends so much time speaking of the so called carbon footprint and yet he flies all the way to hawaii on a massive old 747
see sanders backed hillary on emails at the debate hurting himself and then she threw him under the bus (but failed) disloyal person
the last thing our country needs is another bush dumb as a rock
@jebbush has embarrassed himself and his family with his incompetent campaign for president he should remain true to himself
weak and ineffective @jebbush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response false advertising
i have an idea for @jebbush whose campaign is a disaster try using your last name and don’t be ashamed of it
@melindadc don’t misrepresent in order to make a point i was always tough on isis as you’ll find out after i get elected
hillary clinton is weak and ineffective no strength no stamina
jeb bush had a tough night at the debate now he'll probably take some of his special interest money he is their puppet and buy ad's
thank you for the nice words @ktmcfarland the debate was interesting and fun keep up the great work
will be interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 800 pm will be talking about the debate and more
bill o'reilly calls trump and campaign brilliant in first place by 27 points
@markhalperin works so hard but just doesn't have a natural instinct for politics others do and those are the people you want to follow
thank you @davidaxelrod for your nice words this morning on @cnn it was a good night
thank you so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night all polls agree it was fun and interesting
highly respected public policy polling (ppp) just announced that i am number one in iowa thank you
 #joetheismann was great as a political analyst on @foxnews he knows far more than football thanks for the nice words joe
i won every debate so far according to all debate polls including @drudge_report @time @slate and more too bad dopey @megynkelly lies
between iraq war monger @krauthammer dummy @karlrove deadpan @georgezwill highly overrated @megynkelly among others @foxnews not fair
i am in trump international hotel las vegas getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight look forward  hope i get treated fairly
i wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight no matter how well i do bad
@megynkelly is very bad at math she was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and cruz in the new monmouth poll 41to14
@megynkelly the most overrated anchor at @foxnews worked hard to explain away the new monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead she said 15
why isn't anyone using the @cnn iowa poll with me having a big lead they only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place)dishonest press
isn't it amazing that @cnn paid a fortune for an iowa poll which shows me in first place over cruz by 13 percent 33 percent to 20 percent then doesn't use it
wow i just had two very good iowa polls and a phenomenal just out national poll from @abc @washingtonpost 38 percent make america great again
people have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems
i was disappointed that ted cruz would speak behind my back get caught and then deny it well welcome to the wonderful world of politics
i did interview with chris wallace of @foxnews in order to be fair he then puts on rove lane and will three trump bashers to discuss
many think that the championship course at turnberry home of the duel in the sun will be the worlds best after the renovation

@chucktodd is a nice guy  but just hopeless he knows so little about politics and in particular winning i fixed his rating problem
@morning_joe just went off the rails i will beat hillary easily she does not want to run against me i am tuning them out waste of time
@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses he should bring them out into the open more fun that way
looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack i am leading by so much he must i hope so he will fall like all others will be easy
@morning_joe is so off on iowa which i am leading big in new @cnn poll i will win iowa also i beat hillary easily
great evening last night in new hampshire got the endorsement from the new england police union big territory great people thank you

i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends this morning at 730 so much to talk about
wow my poll numbers have just been announced and have gone through the roof
@megynkelly spent a big part of her show talking about other shows spending so much time on me really weird she's being driven crazy
weak and totally conflicted people like @therickwilson shouldn't be allowed on television unless given an iq test dumb as a rock @cnn
great interview tonight @donlemon very professionally done @cnn
thank you @oreillyfactor for your wonderful editorial as to why i should have been @time magazine's person of the year you should run time
why does @cnn bore their audience with people like @secupp a totally biased loser who doesn't have a clue i hear she will soon be gone
@secupp who can't believe that her candidate has bombed so badly is one of the dumber pundits on tv hard to watch zero talent @cnn
@donlemon on @cnn at 1000 pm
i am interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 800 then at 1000 i am interviewed by @donlemon on @cnn enjoy
@mayor_nutter of philadelphia who is doing a terrible job should be ashamed for using such a disgusting word in referring to melow life
i told you @time magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite they picked person who is ruining germany
hillary clinton does not have the strength or stamina to be president we need strong and super smart for our next leader or trouble
the last person corrupt hillary clinton wants to run against is donald j trump i'll end up beating her in every state new fox poll trump
the failing @nytimes does not mention the new @cnn poll that has me leading iowa by a massive 13 points i am at 33 percent maggie haberman sad
great poll numbers just coming out of new hampshire big lead for "trump" according to @cnn
wow what a day so many foolish people that refuse to acknowledge the tremendous danger and uncertainty of certain people coming into us

just won iowa @cnn poll big trump 33 percent cruz 20 percent rubio 11 percent but @wsj reported "cruz momentum" but nothing about the fact that i easily won
if @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag the @washingtonpost scam is saving it
the @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @jeffbezos power to screw public on low taxation of @amazon big tax shelter
the @washingtonpost which loses a fortune is owned by @jeffbezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company @amazon
nyc has the worst mayor in the united states i hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets the homeless and crime disgrace

obama said in his speech that muslims are our sports heroes what sport is he talking about and who is obama profiling
thank you graham ledger of the daily ledger @oann for your really fair coverage and your great interview with peter roff of us news and wr
well obama refused to say (he just can't say it) that we are at war with radical islamic terrorists
should have gone after the oil years ago (like i have been saying)
wish obama would say isis like almost everyone else rather than isil
is that all there is we need a new president fast
hope he won't spend too much time ripping apart the 2nd amendment
the podium in the oval office looks odd not good but the words will be the key
hillary won't call out radical islam she will be soundly defeated

i want to thank all my friends in macon for the special evening and great reception what a crowd of incredible people
meeting with african american pastors at trump tower was amazing wonderful news conference followed now off to georgia for big speech
the republican establishment out of self preservation is concerned w/ my high poll #'s more concerned are dems i beat hillary heads up
when will @cnn get some real political talent rather than political commentators like errol louis who doesn't have a clue others bad also
great job @mariatcardona on @thisweekabc you made kooky cokie roberts and @billkristol look even dumber than they are you will be right
after my meeting with the pastors it's off to georgia for a big rally many thousands of great people will be there a beautiful movement
will be meeting on monday at trump tower with a large group of african american pastors many i know wonderful people not a press event
just watched cookie roberts on @abc her predictions have been so wrong for so long that she has lost all credibility just another sad case
@cnn has to do better reporting if it wants to keep up with the crowdso totally one sided and biased against me that it is becoming boring
i will be on @meetthepress in an interview with @chucktodd on sunday morning so much to talk about
the sarasota florida rally today was amazing 12000 people chanting their love for our country it's going to happen this is a movement
@cnn kayleigh mcenany was great on you network today you should have her on more often thank you kayleigh for your nice words
virtually no one has spent more money in helping the american people with disabilities than me will discuss today at my speech in sarasota
the reporter who pulled back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun i don't know what he looks like and don't know him
the failing @nytimes should focus on fair and balanced reporting rather than constant hit jobs on me yesterday 3 boring articles today2
i do not know the reporter for the @nytimes or what he looks like i was showing a person groveling to take back a statement made long ago
happy thanksgiving to all have a great day and look forward to the future we will make america great again
the numbers at the @nytimes are so dismal especially advertising revenue that big help will be needed fast a once great institution sad
so since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade why do people care what they write incompetent
the dopes at the @nytimes bought the boston globe for $13 billion and sold it for $100 their great old headquarters gave it away so dumb
the @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control with unfunded liabilities big trouble
a wonderful evening in south carolina big crowd amazing energy
will be doing @seanhannity at 10 pm on @foxnews as always with sean will be interesting

when you do your christmas shopping remember how disloyal @macys was to the subject of illegal immigration #boycottmacys #dumpmacys
going to columbus ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands the silent majority is no longer silent
@ap has one of the worst reporters in the business @jeffhorwitz wouldn’t know the truth if it hit him in the face
@ap continues to do extremely dishonest reporting always looking for a hit to bring them back into relevancy ain’t working
hillary clinton is weak on illegal immigration among many other things she is strong on corruption corruption is what she's best at
@heytana great job we are all proud of you

the media must denigrate isis at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it these are low level degenerates not masterminds
the media must immediately stop calling isis leaders "masterminds" call them instead thugs and losers young people must not go into isis
the legendary barbara walters interviews melania trump and me on a special this friday night at 1000 on abc don't miss it
the police in paris did a fantastic job very brave not easy
everyone is now saying how right i was with illegal immigration and the wall after paris they’re all on the bandwagon
eight syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the us isis maybe i told you so we need a big and beautiful wall
i will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 1000 on @foxnews  much much much to talk about
melania and i just had interview with the legendary @barbarajwalters watch #abc2020 this friday tonight we talk isis @wntonight
@ap is doing very badly i can say from experience their reporting is terrible and highly inaccurate sadly they are now irrelevant
one of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great @ap they have lost their way and are no longer credible
refugees from syria are now pouring into our great country who knows who they are some could be isis is our president insane
i along with almost everyone else have so little confidence in president obama he has a horrible attitude a man who is resigned to defeat
so many great polls like reuters big leads everywhere new hampshire really special we will win big and make america great again
just landing in knoxville tennessee massive crowd expected will all have a great time despite serious subject matter
republicans must stop listening to dopes like @karlrove who still insists mitt romney won the last election think big and think strong
wow @macys shares are down more than 40 percent this year i never knew my ties and shirts not being sold there would have such a big impact
remember i was the one who said attack the oil (isis source of wealth) a long time ago everyone scoffed now they're attacking the oil
tom brady just did it again he is not only a great guy he is without question the best quarterback
president obama just told president putin how important the russian air strikes against isis have been i told you so
@johnlegere @tmobile john focus on running your company i think the service is terrible try hiring some good managers
glad to see that @rondarousey lost her championship fight last night was soundly beaten not a nice person
i have watched sloppy graydon carter fail and close spy magazine and now am watching him fail at @vanityfair magazine he is a total loser
@vanityfair magazine is doing really poorly it has gotten worse and worse over the years and has lost almost all of it's former allure
we need strong tough and brilliant leadership now more than ever make america great again
i had a great time in texas yesterday a tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people will be back soon
when will president obama issue the words radical islamic terrorism he can't say it and unless he will the problem will not be solved
i think everyone will like my new and very successful book crippled america go get it and let me know what you think
wow bernie sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10 percent (it is actually over 20 percent) and for african american youth 51 percent
hillary and sanders are not doing well but what is the failed former mayor of baltimore doing on that stage o'malley is a clown
why won't president obama use the term islamic terrorism isn't it now after all of this time and so much death about time
we need much tougher much smarter leadership and we need it now
president obama said "isil continues to shrink" in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in paris he is just so bad change
@seanhannity carly whose campaign is dead is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope sad
@carlyfiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning ben carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign
@carlyfiorina i only said i was on @60minutes four weeks ago with putin never said i was in green room separate pieces great ratings
@carlyfiorina ben carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper and pathological disease i didn’t say it he did apology
@carlyfiorina carly i did graduate from wharton and did very well who is your fact checker will you apologize
@carlyfiorina carly not just you i also told gov kasich to “let jeb talk give him a chance” because kasich was constantly cutting in
wow pres candidate ben carson who is very weak on illegal immigration just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship
why does the failing @wsj write a false editorial about me and let dummy @karlrove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper
@karlrove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re china and tpp this moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100 percent
we as a country either have borders or we don't if we don't have borders we don't have a country
why wouldn't the @wsj call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong no wonder it is doing poorly
when and how are the dummies at the @wsj going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect editorial on me i want "smart" trade deals
the @wsj editorial board is so wrong so often they got info from an incorrect story in another pub why not watch and listen to debate
@wsj editorial board should review my debate statement re china and tpp and apologize china not part but will get their way in later
today's @wsj editorial is wrong again i know that china is not in the new tpp trade deal but would come in latter through a back door
i will be interviewed on @mariabartiromo @foxbusiness at 730
all seven on line polls including drudge and time with thousands of respondents said i won the debate @krauthammer said i was "so so"
will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 pm
i will be on @marklevinshow at 8pm tonight tune in
@gerardtbaker gerard wonderful job last night as moderator of the debate i told many “really smart and elegant”
i never said that china was in the bad tpp trade deal but that china would come in the back door at a later date @cnn @foxbusiness
just returned home from the great state of new hampshire have made so many friends there special place
happy veterans day to those who have served thank you for your special work
loved doing the debatewon drudge and all on line polls amazing evening moderators did an outstanding job
will be on @morning_joe live from new hampshire 700 am talking about the debate and more
go out and buy crippled america how to make america great again doing really well great thanksgiving or christmas present
i will be interviewed by @gstephanopoulos on @gma at 700 am there is much to talk about
thank you to all of those who gave me such wonderful reviews for my performance on @nbcsnl saturday night live best ratings in 4 years
@ericshawnonfox highest rated saturday night live in four years 47 percent higher than their opening night with hillary and miley cyrus nice words
television ratings for @nbcsnl saturday night live just came out and they were great the best since 2011 very few protesters
@nbcsnl so much fun last night
will be on @foxandfriends at 800 am
amazing evening at saturday night live
i am at the saturday night live studio electricity all over the place we will be doing a "tweeting" skit so stay tuned
they are saying that tickets to tonight's saturday night live are the hardest to get in the history of this great show off to a good start
saturday night live has some incredible things in store tonight the great thing about playing myself is that it will be authentic enjoy
@robertgbeckel please thank your brother for his nice words on television seems like a great guy and character @cnn
one of the dumbest political pundits on television is chris stirewalt of @foxnews wrong facts check fox debate rankings trump #1 dope
would be nice if @jmartnyt learned how to read the polls before writing his next story probably done on purpose but not good reporting
@billkristol has become a sad case his magazine is failing badly probably doesn't have long to go and his predictions are always wrong
so sad that obama rejected keystone pipeline thousands of jobs good for the environment no downside
happy birthday to the great @billygraham he's done so many wonderful things not the least of which is his fantastic family i love billy
@ajdelgado13 thank you so much for the nice words and support really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts
i think it would be a good idea and fair to include @govchristie and @mikehuckabeegop in the debate both solid and good guys @foxbusiness
such bad reporting a puff piece on ben carson in the @nytimes states that carson "is trying to solidify his lead" but i am #1 easily sad
florida ethics commission advocate comes down hard on rubio so do two people who worked with him said he used the wrong credit card sure
a great honor to easily finish first in the @foxnews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner
the carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worse trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend
@seanhannity should have corrected jeb bush when he said that i "ran for president twice" never ran merely considered running
just landed in new hampshire a very exciting morning planned
isn't it terrible that @megynkelly used a poll not used before (ibd) when i was down but refuses to use it now when i am up
i will be interviewed on @gma at 700 am and @foxandfriends at 750 talking about my new book out today crippled america
join me tomorrow nov 3rd at 12pm in #trumptowerny i’ll be signing copies of my new book crippled america don’t miss it
@charlesmblow why don’t you use new polls instead of the single ancient national poll that was a tiny bit negative dishonest reporting
thank you carl higbie (former navy seal) for you support of my plan to straighten out the veterans administration a messgreat job @kilmeade
@morning_joe marco only won the debate in the minds of desperate people i won every on line poll even crazy @cnbc marco good looking
sirius national news at 730 am steve bannon @breitbartnews
now that iran ripped us off by making one of the best deals of any kind in history they have just moved to block any imports from the us
thank you @joetrippi for the nice and true words on #media buzz with terrific howie kurtz leading new hampshire 30 to 12 @foxnews
while in politics it is often smart to send out false messages one thing is clear that hillary does not want to run against trump
if jeb bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with marco in the debate bad facts for marco if properly delivered
marco rubio will not win weak on illegal immigration strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight"
i told you in speeches months ago that jeb and marco do not like each other marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to jeb as his mentor
jeb's new slogan "jeb can fix it" i never thought of jeb as a crook stupid message the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics
further proof that gang of eight member marco rubio is weak on illegal immigration is paul singer's mr amnesty endorsement rubs can't win
@thehill john oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show i said "no thanks" waste of time and energy
few people know that @fortunemagazine is still in business tell your writer alisa soloman that i left the apprentice to run for president
no complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if i wasn't in them interesting question
thank you james freeman of the @wsj for the very nice words all polls said i won the debate except nbc (3rd) explain to daniel henninger
support coach kennedy and his right together with his young players to pray on the football field liberty institute just suspended him
the @wsj wall street journal loves to write badly about me they better be careful or i will unleash big time on them look forward to it
lifting off right now for uss wisconsin in norfolk see ya'
i told you so @politico just lost it's top person poor results and no money to pay him if they were legit they would be doing far better
i am leaving for norfolk virginia the great battleship uss wisconsin for a big rally and really big crowd see you soon
i see marco rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his superpac which are total scams marco must address him as "sir"
the new nbc poll has me in first place but said i was third in the debate i demand a recount (just kidding) every other poll had me #1
black lives matter protesters totally disrupt hillary clinton event she looked lost this is not what we need with isis china russia etc
i am going to save medicare and medicaid carson wants to abolish and failing candidate gov john kasich doesn't have a clue weak
when candidate john kasich on the @oreillyfactor talked about dismantling medicare and medicaid he was referring to ben carson
@govmikehuckabee great job on @foxnews tonight thanks for your nice words about my children class
super pacs should be disavowed by anyone running for president they are a total scam on our system and country i am self funding
thank you @rushlimbaugh for your wonderful words we will #makeamericagreatagain
happy birthday to my wonderful daughter @ivankatrump
thank you @morning_joe for explaining to @cnn and @andersoncooper and so many others that i am leading in almost all national and state polls
thank you @charleshurt for the nice words on @seanhannity i will win and make america great again
loved doing the debate last night on @cnbc check out all of the polls everyone agrees that harwood bombed
wow just heard really bad stuff about the failing @politico how much longer will they be around some very untalented reporters
join me tuesday nov 3rd at 12pm in trump tower nyc i’ll be signing copies of my new book crippled america don’t miss it
@speakerryan congratulations and good luck you will do a great job for our wonderful usa
failing host @glennbeck a mental basketcase loves superpacs in other words he wants your politicians totally controlled by lobbyists
thank you to everybody for your wonderful comments on my debate performance it was a lot of fun today i will be speaking in reno nevada
thank you @morningmika and @joenbc for all of your nice words and comments on the debate
the money losing @politico is considered by many in the world of politics to be the dumbest and most slanted of the political sites losers
@cnbc poll total trump 2522 carson 1978 rubio 967
@theeconomist poll one of the most highly respected was just released wow wait until the media digests these numbers won't be happy
does anybody think that @cnbc will get their fictitious polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate sad
@morning_joe can you believe kasie hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in iowa @politico is a scam
@cnbc continues to report fictious poll numbers number one based on every statistic is trump (by a wide margin) they just can't say it
after a great evening and packed auditorium in iowa i am now in colorado looking forward to what i am sure will be a very unfair debate
i am leaving for sioux city iowa great event (rally)
new gravis national poll just out  36 percent very nice #makeamericagreatagain
dopey @billkristol who has lost all credibility with so many dumb statements and picks said last week on @morning_joe that biden was in
all presidential candidates should immediately disavow their super pac’s they're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself
re super pac scam what the other candidates are doing is a disgrace
this whole super pac scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all pac's and is self funding
leaving for new hampshire now will be doing the @todayshow there live at 700 am new @cbsnews poll of new hampshire trump 38 carson 12
remember that carson bush and rubio are very weak on illegal immigration they will do nothing to stop it our country will be overrun
do you think i will get credit for keeping ford in us who cares my supporters know the truth think what can be done as president
word is that ford motor because of my constant badgering at packed events is going to cancel their deal to go to mexico and stay in us
@byronyork great numbers from @cbsnews poll also from abc washington post poll thank you @cnn
do you believe that @foxnews is still playing up the old iowa poll numbers and no mention of the abcwashington post or just out cbs results
@cbsnews poll wow new hampshire trump 38 percent carson 12 percent bush 8 percent south carolina trump 40 percent carson 23 percent cruz 8 percent iowa trump 27 percent carson 27 percent
watch my interview on @cbsnews face the nation now and also the new cbs polls which if good for me the media won't report
big poll comes out today on face the nation at 1030 on @cbsnews
watch @cnn at 900 am @jaketapper then interviewed on @abc @gstephanopoulos at 1000 am and then at 1030 am watch face the nation
ben carson has never created a job in his life (well maybe a nurse) i have created tens of thousands of jobs it's what i do
i spell out some of the differences between ben carson and myself at 900 am on @cnn @jaketapper ben is very weak on illegal immigration
a big poll will be announced this morning on @cbsnews face the nation i wonder if i do well if the press will report the results doubt it
this is just not the right time for jeb bush his campaign is in total disarray too much staff being paid way too much money = us govt
while jeb bush is cutting staff and salaries after having paid ridiculous amounts of money why did he pay so much in the first place
just finished speaking in jacksonville florida incredible crowd fantastic people thank you
leaving for jacksonville now see you there miami was great
massive crowds already forming in jacksonville will be and incredible day 12 noon make america great again
the young intern who accidentally did a retweet apologizes
i think joe biden made correct decision for him and his family personally i would rather run against hillary because her record is so bad
new poll by abc news/washington post trump 32 carson 22 rubio 10 bush 7 wow how will the media put a negative spin on this one
i will be interviewed on @gma good morning america at 700 am @abc will be announcing new poll numbers make america great again
just out boston herald/franklin pierce poll nh trump 28 (up 10) carson 16 bush 9 rubio 6 cruz 5 press will say they are surging

@karlrove had my best day ever in the polls one had me at 41 percent morning consult boston globe monmouth nbc and cnn all great more
i will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 1000 you will find it very interesting (i hope) enjoy
i will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10 pm @foxnews #hannity
jeb is fighting to defend a catastrophic event i am fighting to make sure it doesn't happen againjeb is too soft we need tougher and sharper
it's really cold outside they are calling it a major freeze weeks ahead of normal man we could use a big fat dose of global warming
fox news sunday with chris wallace will be re broadcast on @foxnews at 600 pm
it's amazing that some of the dumbest people on television work for the wall street journal in particular a real dope named charles lane
i will be interviewed by chris wallace at 200 pm on @foxnews turn off the football for 15 minutes make america great again
replay of fox news sunday with chris wallace at 200 pm on @foxnews big statement made by chris
i should release the sad and totally apologetic letter that penn @pennjillette hand delivered to me minds would be changed very fast
@mittromney and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost
@mittromney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because i have been openly hard on his terrible "choke" loss to obama
@foxnewssunday
jeb why did your brother attack and destabalize the middle east by attacking iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction bad info
this morning chris wallace has the best political show on television but that's only because i'm on it (kidding) have fun
jeb bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them also rubio is hitting him hard
on at 900am or 1000 am (depending on your location) on fox is a tough but really good interview with chris wallace enjoy
i will be interviewed on fox news sunday with chris wallace at 900 am or 1000 am (depending on location) will be tough but good
@katrinapierson you did a fantastic job tonight on @foxnews thank you for your very tough and very smart representation
@scottienhughes keep up the great work scottie polls are best ever
every poll time drudge slate and others said i won both debates but heard megyn kelly had her two puppets say bad stuff i don't watch
@marcthiessen is a failed bush speechwriter whose work was so bad that he has never been able to make a comeback a third rate talent
megyn kelly has two really dumb puppets chris stirewalt and marc threaten (a bushy) who do exactly what she says all polls say i won debates
will be on @bloombergtv tomorrow with @sruhle enjoy
why is the @gop being asked to do a debate that is so much longer than the just aired and very boring #demdebate
@cnbc is pushing the @gop around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials
the @gop should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @cnbc is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party
@kevinhart4real joined @woodmank104 @katek104 @k1047 and was asked about his thoughts on @realdonaldtrump #trump2016 thanks kevin so nice
@andersoncooper did an excellent job of hosting the #demdebate last night tough firm but fair
steven tyler got more publicity on his song request than he’s gotten in ten years good for him
even though i have the legal right to use steven tyler’s song he asked me not to have better one to take its place
will be going to richmond virginia today big crowd see you there
the debate last night proved that hillary is running against the “b” team she won’t be so lucky when it comes to me
#demdebate was really boring but had a lot of fun live tweeting and picked up by far the most followers
like her or not hillary did what she had to do in the debate last night get through it her opponents were very gentle and soft
check out oan and compare to what you are watching now
notice that illegal immigrants will be given obamacare and free college tuition but nothing has been mentioned about our veterans #demdebate
sanders said only black lives matter wow hillary did not answer question
sorry there is no star on the stage tonight
good move by bernie s
the hardest thing clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including iraq vote emails etc
all are very scripted and rehearsed two (at least) should not be on the stage
who is winning the debate so far (just last name) #demdebate
o'malley as former mayor of baltimore has very little chance
can anyone imagine chafee as president no way
the trade deal is a disaster she was always for it #demdebate
should be interesting but too bad the three guys at《1 percent will be taking up so much time but who knows maybe a star will be born (unlikely)
how can jeb bush expect to deal with china russia + iran if he gets caught doing a “plant” during my speech yesterday in nh
everybody's talking about my doing twitter during the likely very boring debate tonight @realdonaldtrump #demdebate
the arrogant young woman who questioned me in such a nasty fashion at no labels yesterday was a jeb staffer how can he beat russia and china
sheldon adelson is looking to give big dollars to rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet i agree
someone should inform @cnn that despite spending millions of $'s on graphics it is not the democratic debate rather the democrat (s) d
at the request of many and even though i expect it to be a very boring two hours i will be covering the democrat debate live on twitter
leaving soon after a great time in new hampshire a truly special place
great everyone is saying i did much better on @60minutes last week than president obama did tonight i agree
president obama was terrible on @60minutes tonight he said climate change is the most important thing not all of the current disasters
i will be on face the nation (cbs) today at 1030 am and media buzz (fox news) at 1100 am enjoy
just got back from georgia the crowds and love for us was so amazing we all had a great day together will be back soon
little barry diller who lost a fortune on newsweek and daily beast only writes badly about me he is a sad and pathetic figure lives lie
i'm leading big in every poll and we are going to win remember trump never gives up
paul ryan is far from my first choice but a very nice guy the republicans should go for tough and (very) smart this time no games
heading for atlanta tomorrow morning for noon speech at north atlanta trade center big crowds great people

what a time we all had in iowa yesterday massive overflow crowd love them
wow great news i hear @ewerickson of red state was fired like a dog if you read his tweets you'll understand why just doesn't have it
i hear @glennbeck is in big trouble unlike me his viewers and ratings are way down and he has become irrelevant glad i didn’t do his show
wacky @glennbeck who always seems to be crying (worse than boehner) speaks badly of me only because i refuse to do his show a real nut job
just arrived in las vegas for a packed house speech tomorrow big poll results today leading big everywhere make america great again
iowa was amazing today great crowd great people thanks will be back soon
@stuartpstevens made some of the dumbest political decisions of all time in helping romney to get destroyed by obama should have won
@politico has no power but so dishonest
i wonder why somebody doesn't do something about the clowns @politico and their totally dishonest reporting
heading to a packed house in waterloo iowa will celebrate today's great poll numbers together see you soon
if stuart stevens' book is as bad as his horrible political advice to mitt romney don't waste your money arrogant guy but a zero
ben carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman and was not criticizing the victims not fair
crooked @club4growth has given up advertising in iowa on me remember they wanted my million dollars i said no total frauds
@waynenewtonmrlv wayne such a pleasant surprise so nice thank you very much
don't ever forget we will together make america great again
so so so important make america great again
political strategist stuart stevenswho led romney down the tubes in what should have been an easy victoryhas terrible political instincts
thoughts and prayers for those in the floods affecting the great people of south carolina
the incompetence of our current administration is beyond comprehension tpp is a terrible deal
for all of my fantastic supporters and for the usa we are going to win and make america great again maybe greater than ever before
will be interviewed by @chucktodd on @meetthepress at 1030 am
will be interviewed by @gstephanopoulos on @abc at 1000 am
rubio was very disloyal to bush his mentor when he decided to run against him both said they "love" each otherthey don't word is hate
bush and rubio are finally attacking each other as i knew they would in order to be the last "establishment" man standing against megreat
thank you @megynkelly for the nice things you said about melania you will like her great heart and smart always wanting to help people
will be in nashville tennessee tomorrow (saturday) at 230 pm so much to talk about see you there
i was so looking forward to being in virginia beach virginia today the demand for tickets was amazing good luck with storm back soon
my warmest condolences to the families of the horrible roseburg oregon shootings
@mittromney is trying to hit back at me because i'm saying that he let the repub party down w/ his loss to obama should've won he choked
just got back from new hampshire great crowd great people will be back soon
i will be interviewed by @donlemon tonight on @cnn at 10pm
rubio is totally owned by the lobbyists and special interests a lightweight senator with the worst voting record in senate lazy
just read that "trump" has the largest (and i add most enthusiastic) crowds tonight i will be in new hampshire the place will be packed
i watched lightweight senator marco rubio who is all talk and no action defend his weak position on illegal immigration pathetic
carl icahn said this about me "i think at this moment in time he’s the only candidate that speaks out about the country’s problems"
i hope when rand paul gets out of the race he is at 1 percent his supporters come over to me i will do a much better job for them
prediction rand paul has been driven out of the race by my statements about him he will announce soon 1 percent
do you believe this iran wants to trade our 3 prisoners (not 4) for 19 prisoners held by the us should have been let go with last deal
will be doing @outfrontcnn with @erinburnett tonight at 7 pm re tax reductions and various other topics
hope we all enjoy @60minutes tomorrow night i do believe they will treat me fairly
marco rubio is a member of the gang of eight or very weak on stopping illegal immigration only changed when poll numbers crashed
i am now inspecting the old post office on pennsylvania avenue will be a great hotel soon off to the oklahoma state fair
@megynkelly the @foxnews poll said very plainly i came in second in the debate all others time drudge slate etc said i came in 1st
just watched @marcorubio on television just another all talk no action politician truly doesn't have a clue worst voting record in sen
despite the establishment and the media’s best efforts the people are speaking loudly and clearly thank you to my amazing supporters
so happy about my daughter @ivankatrump’s announcement that she will be having a baby this spring congratulations
will be on @morning_joe at 630 am
will be on @cnn at 700 am
@foxnews has been treating me very unfairly and i have therefore decided that i won't be doing any more fox shows for the foreseeable future
headline reads" rubio passes bush in florida poll" unfair because trump destroys them both trump 315 percent rubio 192 percent bush 113 percent
@juliinkster congratulations on your great win what a captain what a champion
i will be the featured guest on the season opener of @60minutes this sunday there certainly is plenty to talk about
just remember the birther movement was started by hillary clinton in 2008 she was all in
i think @megynkelly should take another eleven day "unscheduled" vacation
do you ever notice that lightweight @megynkelly constantly goes after me but when i hit back it is totally sexist she is highly overrated
senator marco "amnesty" rubio who has worst voting record in senate just hit me on national security but i said don't go into iraq vision
yom kippur blessings to all of my friends in israel and around the world #yomkippur
2016 republican primary morning consult poll was just released trump 32 carson 12 bush 11 fiorina 6 rubio 5 cruz 5 taken after debate
@richlowry is truly one of the dumbest of the talking heads he doesn't have a clue
i am having a really hard time watching @foxnews
@oreillyfactor why don't you have some knowledgeable talking heads on your show for a change instead of the same old trump haters boring
@oreillyfactor was very negative to me in refusing to to post the great polls that came out today including nbc @foxnews not good for me
#asktrump send me your questions to answer live from @twitternyc later this afternoon
carly fiorina did such a horrible job at lucent and hp virtually destroying both companies that she never got another ceo job offer pres
we are going to win and make america great again maybe better than ever before
i am attracting the biggest crowds by far and the best poll numbers also by far much of the media is totally dishonest so sad
i have been leading big in all polls with two more today @nbc and @cnn the nbc poll is more than double next at 29 percent fiorina has 11 percent
there is no way that carly fiorina can become the republican nominee or win against the dems boxer killed her for senate in california
i will be on @meetthepress at 1030 @nbc will be releasing their new poll numbers based on the debate results i should do well who knows
on my way to iowa will be landing in des moines in two hours see ya
christians need support in our country (and around the world) their religious liberty is at stake obama has been horrible i will be great
if i would have challenged the man the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech a no win situation
if someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president do you really think he would come to my rescue no chance
this is the first time in my life that i have caused controversy by not saying something
am i morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him i don't think so
give america back its dream  donald j trump
would be really bad if columnist mike lupica left the @nydailynews a wonderful and talented guy
will be interviewed tonight by @seanhannity on @foxnews at 10 pm enjoy
going to new hampshire in a little while big crowds #makeamericagreatagain
every poll done on debate last night from drudge to newsmax to time magazine had me winning in a landslide #makeamericagreatagain

@club4growth asked me for $1 million i said no now falsely advertising that i will raise taxes i’ll lower big league for middle class

very good news the new quinnipiac poll just came out i am #1 in iowa
i will be on the tonight show with jimmy fallon tonight at 1130 should be fun @jimmyfallon
 i only respond to people that register more than 1 percent in the polls i never thought he had a chance and i’ve been proven right
bobby jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore i have never met him…
i'll be on @greta on the record tonight at 7 pm
wow i am ahead of the field with evangelicals (am so proud of this) and virtually every other group and ben carson just took a swipe at me
i had a great day in dc even though the subject was an unpleasant one the horrible iran nuke deal amazing crowd and enthusiasm
man did jeb throw his brother under the bus last night on @colbertlateshow  probably true but not nice
see you in dc tomorrow at 100 pm at the capitol to protest the horribly negotiated deal with iran really sad
will be on bill o'reilly @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 pm enjoy
i'm on bill @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 pm it will be another lively interview about how to #makeamericagreatagain
jeb’s policies in florida helped lead to its almost total collapse right after he left he went to work for lehman brothers wow
the lobbyists and special interests have just put out an ad for jeb which hits me "just a little" but is very false
i’m self funding my campaign but lobbyists and special interests for jeb and others are starting to do big ads desperate don’t believe them
thank you @ingrahamangle for your strength and wonderful words last night on @foxnews but @karlrove is easy to beat
tomorrow in dc 1 pm west front lawn of the capitol not even believable that we would do this deal with iran
look forward to being in dc tomorrow big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with iran
looking forward to being with @sentedcruz at our big rally in dc on wednesday (100 pm at the capitol) to protest insane iran nuke deal
both washington dc and dallas are turning out to be really big events dc is protest of incompetent iran deal and dallas is big speech
remember i'll see you in dc at the capitol building on wednesday at 100 o'clock then dallas on sept14 at 600 pm american air center
thank you @scottienhughes for your powerful words on @foxnews i am with the evangelicals and tea party big time we will all win together
@club4growth should release the letter they sent me asking for $1000000 when i said no they came out against me a scam operation
i will be in washington dc on wednesday1 pmin front of the capitol to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with iran
the dallas event on september 14 at 600 pm at the american airlines center looks like it will be a giant success tickets are going fast
our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision not someone like hillary or barack neither of which has a clue
the phony club for growth which asked me in writing for $1000000 (i said no) is now wanting to do negative ads on me total hypocrites
the hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes asap they are paying practically nothing we must reduce taxes for the middle class
by self funding my campaign i am not controlled by my donors special interests or lobbyists i am only working for the people of the us
remember that i am self funding my campaign hillary jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money100 percent controlled
hillary said such nasty things about me read directly off her teleprompterbut there was no emotion no truth just can't read speeches
hillary clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter i have ever seen in fact it wasn't even see through glass it was black
saudi arabia was "vehemently" against the iran nuclear deal then today they embraced it what happened what did we give them to endorse
just announced that because of "trump" advertising rates for debate on @cnn are going from $5000 to $200000 a 4000 percent increasepay charity
why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like hugh hewitt be doing the next debate on @cnn he is just a 3rd rate "gotcha" guy
very low ratings radio host hugh hewitt asked me about suleiman abu bake al baghdad hassan nasrallah and more typical "gotcha" questions
the dallas event in two weeks at the american airlines center is filling up fast get your tickets fast before it is too late
@meghanmccain was terrible on @thefive yesterday angry and obnoxious she will never make it on tv @foxnews can do so much better
will be on @morning_joe in 5 minutes at 700 enjoy
congratulations to tom brady on yet another great victory tom is my friend and a total winner
the deal with iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made the us lost on virtually every point we just don't win anymore
@brithume i am in first place by a lot in all polls tied for first place with ben carson in one iowa poll i thought you knew this thanks
@kevinolearytv great job on @foxandfriends this morning you tell it like it is also thx for the nice mention your book sounds great
will be interviewed on @gma this morning at 700 thanks for the great poll results
when i intelligently turned down the club for growth crazy request for $1000000 they got nastywhat a waste of money that would have been
the president of the pathetic club for growth came to my office in nyc and asked for a ridiculous $1000000 contribution i said no way
every poll has me winning bigif you listen to dopey karl rove a trump hater on @oreillyfactor you would think i'm doing poorly @foxnews
why does @oreillyfactor and @foxnews always have karl rove on he spent $430 million and lost all races a dope who said romney won election
i’m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions feel totally stupid doing so but hope it is appreciated by the voters
many super pacs funded by groups that want total control over their candidate are being formed to “attack” trump remember when u see them
congrats everyone we topped 4 million today on twitter and heading up fast
while millions are being spent against me in attack ads they are paid for by the “bosses” and “owners” of candidates i am self funding
jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists and special interests bad system
yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign will jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me
just out new ppp national poll has me in first place by a wide margin at 29 percent i wonder why only @foxnews has not reported this too bad
150 clinton emails still contain classified information more sensitive when she was secof state this is a very big deal
president obama wants to change the name of mt mckinley to denali after more than 100 years great insult to ohio i will change back
for those that don’t think a wall (fence) works why don’t they suggest taking down the fence around the white house foolish people
huma abedin the top aide to hillary clinton and the wife of perv sleazebag anthony wiener was a major security risk as a collector of info
leading in the bloomberg iowa poll also my favorability numbers went up at a record almost unheard of clip thank you iowa
loved being with my many friends in tennessee the crowd and enthusiasm was fantastic i won the straw poll big

heading to iowa to a packed house just released polls all first place are amazing thank you
congrats @lindseygrahamsc you just got 4 points in your home state of sc far better than zero nationally you’re only 26 pts behind me
asians are very offended that jeb said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics a mess
in a clumsy move to get out of his "anchor babies" dilemma where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it he blamed asians
jeb bush never uses his last name on advertising signage materials etc is he ashamed of the name bush a pretty sad situation go jeb
i liked the kelly file much better without @megynkelly perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation
@megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation she is really off her game was afraid to confront dr cornel west no clue on immigration
markets are crashing all caused by poor planning and allowing china and asia to dictate the agenda this could get very messy vote trump
as i have long stated we are so tied in with china and asia that their markets are now taking the us market down get smart usa
new reuters poll just came out and has me at 32 percent highest number yetthe silent majority is back and we will make america great again
the last thing we need is another bush in the white house would be the same old thing (remember "read my lips no more taxes") greatness
jeb bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body jeb just can't get it right
jeb bush is weak on illegal immigration in favor of common core bad on women's health issues and thinks the iraq war was a good thing
now that i started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border most other candidates are finally speaking up just politicians
it has just been confirmed by the city of mobile alabama that there were 30000 people at last nights event making it #1for pol season
how is bernie sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone very sad
thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive story on my speech in alabama last night it was a great evening
i had 15000 people in phoenix but @politico said "the rooms capacity is just over 2000" but said bernie sanders had 11000 in same room
@politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source and that is saying something they go out of their way to distort truth
alabama was great last night amazing people 30000 folks was largest crowd of political season nice
dow dives more than 500 points down 9 percent from high be careful
leaving for mobile alabama right now can't be late
boston incident is terrible we need energy and passion but we must treat each other with respect i would never condone violence
how crazy 75 percent of all births in us are to illegal immigrants over 300000 babies per year this must stop unaffordable and not right
jeb bush signed memo saying not to use the term "anchor babies" offensive now he wants to use it because i use it stay true to yourself
alabama will shine tomorrow it will be a big and glorious day
we are going to make our country so strong again so great again no more ripping off the united states we will make america great again
@tomllamasabc cannot report the news truthfully why not apologize for your fraudulent story on world news tonightgang members and criminals
@abcpolitics must apologize my statement "we're going to get them out so fast so quick" applied to hard core criminals and gang members lie
i am looking forward to being in new hampshire tomorrow the silent majority is taking our country back we will make america great again
@ktumulty polls indicate that a trump presidency is now inevitable #august
if i am elected president i will immediately approve the keystone xl pipeline no impact on environment and lots of jobs for us
@jasondhorowitz i am very proud of my sister your story was terrific thank you so much
when foreigners attend our great colleges and want to stay in the us they should not be thrown out of our country
i want talented people to come into this country to work hard and to become citizens silicon valley needs engineers etc

making speech tonight in new hampshire leaving now fantastic people fantastic crowd
@ap and @huffingtonpost should change their fraudulent story to say that i dropped @nbc and the apprentice to run for president
people don’t understand that i left the apprentice to run for pres the apprentice did not leave me bob greenblatt and folks @nbc were great
the #irandeal is a catastrophe that must be stopped will lead to at least partial world destruction and make iran a force like never before
@mikerotondo86 only trump can bring us back from 20 trillion in debt he's the only one with the experience and skill set to do so
will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight for the full hour hope you enjoy it and more importantly hope you agree
@sentedcruz had a very good debate far better than rand paul
@ericbolling you can do much better than you did tonight on @oreillyfactor better luck tomorrow
why is @randpaul allowed to take advantage of the people of kentucky by running for senator and pres why should kentucky be back up plan
we must stop the crime and killing machine that is illegal immigration rampant problems will only get worse take back our country
truly weird senator rand paul of kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain he was terrible at debate
again illegal immigrant is charged with the fatal bludgeoning of a wonderful and loved 64 year old woman get them out and build a wall
@katrinacampins thank you so much for the wonderful statements you made about me on tv also keep up the great work
@brandenroderick i was pleased to see the wonderful statements you made about me to the mediai'm not surprised you're a special person
@omarosa you were fantastic on television this weekend thank you so much – you are a loyal friend
roger ailes just called he is a great guy and assures me that “trump” will be treated fairly on @foxnews his word is always good
@kathielgifford melania and i send our deepest condolences frank was a special and amazing person he will be missed by all
i will be interviewed on @today show at 700 am and on morning joe at 720
wonderful frank gifford has just passed away at age 84 he was my friend and a truly great guy warmest condolences to family
it amazes me that other networks seem to treat me so much better than @foxnews i brought them the biggest ratings in history and i get zip
i just realized that if you listen to carly fiorina for more than ten minutes straight you develop a massive headache she has zero chance
small crowds at @redstate today in atlanta people were very angry at ewerickson a major sleaze and buffoon who has saved me time and money
almost universal support that "trump won the debate" only @foxnews is consistantly fighting the trump win and i got them the ratings
wow cnn just said that donald trump won the debate connected best with audience also time drudge newsmax nytimes and more
re megyn kelly quote "you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out of her wherever" (nose) just got on w/thought
so many "politically correct" fools in our country we have to all get back to work and stop wasting time and energy on nonsense
the hatred that clown @krauthammer has for me is unbelievable – causes him to lie when many others say trump easily won debate
dopey @krauthammer should be fired @foxnews
@foxnews you should be ashamed of yourself i got you the highest debate ratings in your history and you say nothing but bad
i really enjoyed the debate tonight even though the @foxnews trio especially @megynkelly was not very good or professional
@frankluntz your so called "focus groups" are a total joke don't come to my office looking for business again you are a clown
wow @megynkelly really bombed tonight people are going wild on twitter funny to watch
@frankluntz i won every poll of the debate tonight by massive margins @drudge_report and @time so where did you find that dumb panel
@frankluntz is a low class slob who came to my office looking for consulting work and i had zero interest now he picks anti trump panels
i look forward to tonight's "debate" but look far more forward to making america great again it can happen
@realbobmassi who does a show called "bob massi is the property man" on @foxnews really knows his stuff a total pro
amymek amen @realdonaldtrump has drawn more attention to veterans issues in 1 week than these politicians have in decades
@joedurak if jeb is the nominee hillary is our next president
@tweet2u2 #trump only attacks those that attack him first he's not going to be abused by a #politician @marthamaccallum #tcot
do you notice that hillary spews out jeb's name as often as possible in order to give him status she knows trump is her worst nightmare
many of hillary’s donors are the same donors as jeb bush’s all rich will have total control know them well
i will be on @oreillyfactor tonight on @foxnews at 8 pm and 11 pm
thank you @gawker call me on my cellphone 9177568000 and listen to my campaign message

we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them  albert einstein
it came out that huma abedin knows all about hillary’s private illegal emails huma’s pr husband anthony weiner will tell the world
@jrprotalker thanks judy for the wonderful statements on @trumpturnberry great seeing you there and you did a fabulous job on commentary
@dottieandbogey thanks for nice comments over weekend re turnberry you and your husband have fantastic taste also great commentary
despite the false @nytimes story about jeb bush being happy with the trump surge he fell more than anybody and is miserable
wow did the @nytimes fall into the bush trap where his people convinced them how happy he was that i was hurting other candidates and not him
bush is pretending that the "trump surge" is great for him and the @nytimesworld is reporting bush "delight" con job a bush nightmare
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 700 enjoy
i wish good luck to all of the republican candidates that traveled to california to beg for money etc from the koch brothers puppets
@blindtothetruth trump is polling well because he speaks his mind not like some of the career politicians he's running against cowards
if you think you can do a thing or think you can't do a thing you're right henry ford
wow some new and even greater polls thank you

just at a news conference from trump turnberry in scotland everybody was there and will be all over television tonite back on trail saturday
carl cameron @foxnews is the only reporter i know who consistently fumbles and misrepresents poll results he has been so wrong and he hates it
getting ready to leave for my great resort turnberry in scotland hosting the women's british open (biggest tournament) will be back sat
i really like the koch brothers (members of my pb club) but i don't want their money or anything else from them cannot influence trump
people like lawyer elizabeth beck and failed writer harry hurt and others talk about me but know nothing about me crazy
how can a dummy dope like harry hurt who wrote a failed book about me but doesn’t know me or anything about me be on tv discussing trump
trump will make america great #changetheworldin5words
 while tom brady is guilty because he replaced his legal cellphone
per @rushlimbaugh why does hillary clinton get the benefit of the doubt (after she destroys her illegal email server) 
i truly love all of the millions of people who are sticking with me despite so many media lies there is a great silent majority looming
thank you @morning_joe for throwing the pathetic reporter from the failing and money losing daily beast off the air really cool
so many people who know nothing about me are commenting all over tv and the media as though they have great djt insight know nothing
@cnn why is somebody (beck) i beat so soundly all of a sudden an expert on donald trump (all over television) she knows nothing about me
cnn and @cnnpolitics lawyer elizabeth beck did a terrible job against me she lost (i even got legal fees) i loved beating hershe was easy
lawyer elizabeth beck was easy for me to beat ask her clients if they are happy with her results against me got total win and legal fees
@cnn and @cnnpolitics did not say that lawyer beck lost the case and i got legal fees also she wanted to breast pump in front of me at dep
a nation without borders is not a nation at all we must have a wall the rule of law matters jeb just doesn’t get it
while i’m beating my opponents in the polls i’m also beating lobbyists special interests and donors that are supporting them with billions
obama’s nuclear deal with the iranians will lead to a nuclear arms race in the middle east it has to be stopped
#irandeal will go down as one of the dumbest and most dangerous misjudgments ever entered into in history of our country incompetent leader

@cj112connie i don't get the mediatrump is ahead in every poll but won't give him credit they say he won't make it 60 percent of us say yes

@macy’s is a big contributor to @ppfa  anybody against planned parenthood should boycott racial profiling macy’s

the ultra liberal and seriously failing des moines register is begging my team for press credentials to my event in iowa today but they lie
big poll just out by @theeconomist has me in 1st place by a lot a great honor but we have a long way to go to make america great again
getting ready to go to iowa today big crowd will be a great day
isn’t it amazing that @macys paid a massive fine for profiling african americans and then criticized me for discussing illegal immigration
@marklevinshow has written a great book plunder and deceit he powerfully analyzes issues that are crucial to us today read it
@paulkellysr mr trump thanks for saying what millions are thinking we need to turn america around if we want to save her

@williebosshog watched you on @foxandfriends you were great and i appreciate the nice statements i’m sending out for your new book now
you’re just not getting there @danaperino sometimes things just don’t work out but don’t worry no problem
@bobbyjindal watched you on @teamcavuto made some excellent points best wishes
@jaybaby63 mr trump thank you for having a clue and not being afraid of what others think or say about you i want my country back
getting ready to lift off for laredo will land at 1oo pm should be exciting and informative
@billkristol bill your small and slightly failing magazine will be a giant success when you finally back trump country will soar
what a waste of time being interviewed by @andersoncooper when he puts on really stupid talking heads liketim o'brien dumb guy with no clue
boycott @macys no guts no glory besides there are far better stores
@ac360 has the absolutely worst anti trump talking heads on his show dopey writer o'brian knows nothing about me or my wealth a waste
@tedcruz you were terrific on @seanhannity tonight i am going to the border tomorrow
@frankluntz knows nothing about me or my religion came to my office looking for work i had no interest i will save the vets
shouldn’t george will have to give a disclaimer every time he is on fox that his wife works for scott walker
will be interviewed by @andersoncooper on @cnn tonight let’s see if he treats me fairly enjoy
obama still will keep all military recruitment centers and bases gun free zones it has to stop military lives matter
thank you @chucktodd for your commentary last night on @nbcnightlynews very fair we are making progress together
i'm going to the border tomorrow will be seeing some really brave people look forward to a big day
i hear a failing new york newspaper is going to publish one of my old cell phone numbers so original just one of many
i'm glad president obama followed my lead and lowered the flags half staff it's about time
@zachjohnsonpga you're one of the truly great competitiors i’ve said it for years great going winning @openchampionship not surprised
rick perry did an absolutely horrible job of securing the border he should be ashamed of himself gov abbott has since been terrific
good luck to my new friends on your testimony in dc you are amazing people doing something so important stopping illegal immigration
@dillydoesit trump has no problem telling it how it is isn't that what everyone has been wanting from a president #makeamericagreatagain
just got great national poll numbers double digit lead thank you we will all make america great again
wow new @abcnews/@washingtonpost @gop preference poll has donaldtrump 11 points up thank you
i will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 800 will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans illegal immigration etc
look how small the pages have become @wsj looks like a tabloid saving money i assume
this story is no longer about john mccain it’s about our horribly treated vets illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans
it was only after i informed nbc that i wouldn't do the apprentice that they became upset w/ me they couldn’t care less about “inclusion"
@rtmatador trump says things that no one else would even consider saying i agree with him on the immigration situation i love honesty
@_eod i believe we have passed that point there are homeless veterans in usa and yet illegal aliens get government housing
@johnjcarp61 at least we're talking about the #va we weren't a month ago @realdonaldtrump @johnmccain
we will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans
the ever dwindling @wsj which is worth about 1/10 of what it was purchased for is always hitting me politically who cares
i will be making some very big campaign stops next week big crowds and tremendous energy make america great again
the republican party must get tougher and smarter and fast or it will go down to a very big defeat just like the last two times
the veterans administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly john mccain has done nothing to help them but talk
john mccain called thousands of people "crazies" when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in phoenix he owes apology
one of the reasons i am no fan of john mccain is that our vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians i will fix va quickly
why would anybody listen to @mittromney he lost an election that should have easily been won against obama by the wayso did john mccain
congrats to the new gov of texas @gregabbott_tx for taking a tough and bold stance at the border should have been done long ago by perry
i have a proven track record supporting our veterans veterans deserve universal access to care va scandal proves politicians are inept
that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care
it's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans
i will make this right for our great vets
all he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything
john mccain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives
the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years
captured or not all our soldiers are heroes
in addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our vets john mccain let us down by losing to barack obama in his run for president
just left family leadership summit in iowa got a standing ovation from many wonderful people i will be back soon
i am now in iowa getting ready to speak people are always amazed to find out that i am protestant (presbyterian) great
the $10 billion (net worth) is after all debt and liabilities so simple to understand but @cnn and @cnnpolitics is just plain dumb
ratings starved @cnn and @cnnpolitics does not cover me accurately why can't they get it right it's really not that hard
made a speech in arkansas last night before a record gop crowd great spirit and amazing people make america great again
it's driving @ariannahuff and the money losing @huffingtonpost post crazy that i am #1 in their poll and they only write bad stories about me
the liberal clown @ariannahuff told her minions at the money losing @huffingtonpost to cover me as enterainment i am #1 in huff post poll
@genesimmons really great job handling the wise guys  so easy for you such talent i won’t forget
military lives matter end gun free zones our soldiers must be able to protect themselves this has to stop
looking forward to speaking at the @argop reagan rockefeller dinner tonight record crowd we are no longer silent #makeamericagreatagain
get rid of gun free zones the four great marines who were just shot never had a chance they were highly trained but helpless without guns
thoughts and prayers to the families of the four great marines killed today
@governorperry failed on the border he should be forced to take an iq test before being allowed to enter the gop debate
@governorperry just gave a pollster quote on me he doesn't understand what the word demagoguery means
@senjohnmccain should be defeated in the primaries graduated last in his class at annapolis dummy
the thousands of people that showed up for me in phoenix were amazing americans @senjohnmccain called them "crazies" must apologize
leaving for new hampshire now making a speech packed house love it
the iran deal poses a direct national security threat it must be stopped in congress stand up republicans
the worst show in las vegas in my opinion is @pennjillette hokey garbage new york show even worse
dopey @lawrence o’donnell whose unwatchable show is dying in the ratings said that my apprentice $ numbers were wrong he is a fool
no deal is better than a bad deal america out negotiated again #iran
@danforc as a legal immigrant i'm so glad someone standing up for us the millions who do things by the book to earn our place here thx
@karlrove wasted $400 million + and didn’t win one race a total loser @foxnews
@foxnews you shouldn’t have @karlrove on the air he’s a clown with zero credibility a bushy
@bradsteinle great talking to you and your parents fantastic people keep your sister’s very important memory alive big impact
@andydean2014 thank you you were great you can defend me anytime amazing job
i hope the boycott of @macys continues forever so many people are cutting up their cards macy's stores suck and they are bad for usa
i loved firing goofball atheist penn @pennjillette on the apprentice he never had a chance wrote letter to me begging for forgiveness
i hear @pennjillette show on broadway is terrible not surprised boring guy (penn) without the apprentice show would have died long ago
irrelevant clown @karlrove sweats and shakes nervously on @foxnews as he talks "bull" about me has zero cred made fool of himself in '12
@unclelouie clearly trump gets social media his tweets are everywhere and no sugar coating he keeps it real wish all candidates did that
@reevesmh it's been a long time since i've been excited about a candidate how refreshing to have a bold voice go trump
@stephenbaldwin7 you were fabulous on cnn last night i greatly appreciate your support best wishes
@foxnews should not put @karlrove on he has no credibility a bush plant who called all races wrong
why do people listen to clown @karlrove on @foxnews spent $430m and lost all races a bushy
@bradsteinle thank you for yr wonderful tweet of july 4 i wanted a little time to go by before calling your sister and family are amazing
getting ready to land in charlottesville virginia at trump vineyards another job producing development that i bought and made amazing
i can't believe that president obama isn't able or willing to make just one phone call to the family of kate steinlecome on pres make call
matt harvey @mets don't let the @nydailynews get you down nobody reads it play well
i absolutely support kate’s law in honor of the beautiful kate steinle who was gunned down in sf by an illegal immigrant
mexico’s totally corrupt gov’t looks horrible with el chapo’s escape totally corrupt us paid them $3 billion
the joke around town is that i freed el chapo from the mexican prison because the timing was so good w/ my statements on border security
@mclaughlingroup greatly appreciate yr wonderful comments this weekend people of “great accomplishment” should easily quality for prez
isn’t it interesting that now that i’m #1 in the polls the networks show polls that are a month old
when will people and the media start to apologize to me for my statement "mexico is sending" which turned out to be true el chapo
likewise billions of dollars gets brought into mexico through the border we get the killers drugs and crime they get the money
el chapo and the mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner sucking drugs and death right into the us
the us will invite el chapo the mexican drug lord who just escaped prison to become a us citizen because our "leaders" can't say no
but that's what i've been saying very unfair treatment by the media
now that the mexican drug lord escaped from prison everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc coming into the us comes over border
i hear that sleepy eyes @chucktodd will be fired like a dog from ratings starved meet the press i can't imagine what is taking so long
trump however would kick his ass
phoenix convention center officials did not want to have thousands of people standing outside in the heat so they let them in a great day
convention center officials in phoenix don't want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing 12 15000 people in 4000 code room
getting ready to go to las vegas (freedom fest) great crowd then on to amazing phoenix that will be a total happening love america
boycott @macys and @univision make america great again
has anyone seen the financials of @univision they are doing really badly too much debt and not enough viewers need money fast funny
jeb bush just announced he raised over $100m everyone of those people who contributed are getting something to the detriment of america
@kpmck63 stay the course mr trump it's easier for others to attack you because you are saying the things that they won't #truth
iran continues to delay the nuclear deal while doing many bad things behind our backs time to walk and double the sanctions stop payments
breaking border security rally in phoenix az at 2pm mst has been moved to @phoenixconvctr build a wall let's make america great again
i'm on @cnn's @ac360 tonight @8pm and @foxnews' @seanhannity @ 10pm discussing immigration and lots of other things#letsmakeamericagreatagain
obama and republicans are hollowing out our military now want to cut troop levels lowest level in over 20 years
@rdbrewer4 trump keep throwing those giant hand grenades into the amnesty debate you're pissing off all the right people in the gop
why does a failed magazine like @forbes constantly seek out trivial nonsense their circulation way down @clare_oc
dummy @clare_oc @forbes tiny fragrance deal with parlux means nothing still sold at trump tower
dummy @clare_oc from failing @forbes magazine nascar deal was 1 nite ballroom espn was small golf outing
dummy writer @clare_oc from failing @forbes magazine works so hard to make such trivial license deals look important…
watched chief negotiator for iran on @charlierose last night he is far smarter than our reps increase sanctions and walk
totally false reporting on my call with @reince priebus he called me ten minutes said i hit a “nerve" doing well end
@caseybierer america needs to hear the truth keep it up mr trump you can help us make america great again never give up
dear @maraliasson i greatly appreciate your fairness my history shows i never disappoint looking forward to meeting you soon
@natalie_gulbis thank you for your support this morning on @golfchannel even more importantly play well this week say hi to all
@ronsirak thank you for being so fair this morning on @golfchannel greatly appreciated
i will be in california this weekend making a speech for clint eastwood then to arizona and vegas big crowds discussing illegals and more
wow i hear that thousands of people are cutting up their @macys credit card that's great #makeamericagreatagain
@anncoulter u were great last nite @ericbolling on fox our country has become a dumping ground for the world i'll get it to stop and fast
people rarely say that many conservatives didn’t vote for mitt romney if i can get them to vote for me we win in a landslide
we have got to take our country back it's time
@absabella mrtrump speaks the truth and will not back down that's why he will be our next president #makeamericagreatagain
thx to all the people who called to say they are cutting their @macys credit card as a protest against illegal immigrants pouring into us
i said simply that the mexican leaders and negotiators are smarter than ours and that the mexican gov't is pushing their hard core to us
thank you @loudobbsnews i will be trying very hard to prove you right great show
jeb bush will never secure our border or negotiate great trade deals for american workers jeb doesn't see and can't solve the problems
i appreciate the gop candidates who remain strong on border security they know i am right a nation without borders cannot survive
rick perry failed at the border now he is critical of me he needs a new pair of glasses to see the crimes committed by illegal immigrants
miss universe paulina vega criticized me for telling the truth about illegal immigration but then said she would keep the crown hypocrite
why would republican candidates want the support of mitt romney he lost an election against obama that should never have been lost
what about the undocumented immigrant with a record who killed the beautiful young women (in front of her father) in san fran get smart
happy 4th of july to everyone make america great again
i will be on @foxandfriends this morning at 830 enjoy
my heartfelt condolences to the family of kathryn steinle very very sad
a nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation president ronald reagan
wow huffington post just stated that i am number 1 in the polls of republican candidates thank you but the work has just begun
mexican leaders and negotiators are much tougher and smarter than those of the us mexico is killing us on jobs and trade wake up
as governor of texas rick perry could have done far more to secure the border but that's ok i like him anyway @governorperry
obama once again just missed a self imposed deadline with iran our leadership is weak and ineffective double the sanctions
@racheljoycowley i'm done with macy's apparently they follow the trend of trying to force legislation on every american freedom done
why doesn’t somebody study the horrible charges brought against @macys for racial profiling terrible hypocrites
@macys stock just dropped interesting so many people calling to say they are cutting up their @macys credit card thank you
who is @macys to pretend innocence when they “racial profile” all over the place paid big fine
interesting that @macys criticized me but just paid $650000 in fines for racial profiling are they racists
@governorpataki couldn’t be elected dog catcher if he ran again so he didn’t
@governorpataki was a terrible governor of ny one of the worst would’ve been swamped if he ran again
@andersoncooper anderson thank you for being so fair with your reporting and story last night greatly appreciated
for all of those who want to #makeamericagreatagain boycott @macys they are weak on border security and stopping illegal immigration
those who believe in tight border security stopping illegal immigration and smart trade deals w/other countries should boycott @macys
get ready for @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 always interesting
watch me on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8pm
@yankeeworshiper thank you to donald trump for standing up for what you believe inleave the bsand lies for hillary and barack
i love the mexican people but mexico is not our friend they're killing us at the border and they're killing us on jobs and trade fight
we must have strong borders and stop illegal immigration without that we do not have a country also mexico is killing us on trade win
remember univision apologized
saudi arabia should be paying the united states many billions of dollars for our defense of them without us gone @alwaleedbint
@nydailynews the dying tabloid owned by dopey clown mort zuckerman puts me on the cover daily because i sell my honor but it is dead
when you are in a war or even a battle losing is not an option
when somebody challenges you unfairly fight back be brutal be tough don't take it it is always important to win
if i win the presidency my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike bush's appointee john roberts on obamacare
@univision cares far more about mexico than it does about the us are they controlled by the mexican government
anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the us should boycott @univision
once again the bush appointed supreme court justice john roberts has let us down jeb pushed him hard remember
i love mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the us so stupidly makes with them really bad for us jobs only good for mexico
univision wants to back out of signed @missuniverse contract because i exposed the terrible trade deals that the us makes with mexico
mexican gov doesn't want me talking about terrible border situation and horrible trade deals forcing univision to get me to stop no way
governor rick scott of florida did really poorly on television this morning i hope he is ok
i hear that dopey political pundit lawrence o'donnell one of the dumber people on television is about to lose his show no ratingstoo bad
we have to bring back and cherish the middle class once the backbone and true strength of the usa it can happen
my message make america great again is beginning to take hold bring back our jobs strengthen our military and borders help our vets
my daughter ivanka did great tonight in new hampshire the sold out crowd loved her and she loved them thanks ivanka
@whoopigoldberg had better surround herself with better hosts than nicole wallace who doesn't have a clue the show is close to death
the ratings for the view are really low nicole wallace and molly sims are a disaster get new cast or just put it to sleep dead tv
i am really beginning to respect mark halperin and john heilemann as political reporters they truly get why "trump" poll numbers are high
just out the new nationwide @foxnews poll has me alone in 2nd place closely behind jeb bush but bush will never make america great again
uncomfortable looking nbc reporter willie geist calls me to ask for favors and then mockingly smiles when he is told of my high poll numbers
@neilyoung’s song “rockin’ in the free world” was just one of 10 songs used as background music didn’t love it anyway
@neilyoung a few months ago neil young came to my office looking for $$ on an audio deal and called me last week to go to his concert wow
my daughter ivanka will be representing me today at the opening of our campaign office in manchester nh #makeamericagreatagain
politician @senatorcardin didn't like that i said baltimore needs jobs and spirit it's politicians like cardin that have destroyed baltimore
the highly respected suffolk university poll just announced that i am alone in 2nd place in new hampshire with jeb bust (bush) in first
@kolbytraveller #trump is more than just talk i hope he wins the election and gets something done for once in this country #trump2016
@williamonlyrent so sick of politicians sugar coating problems and issues it will be so great to have #trump2016 say it like it is
@danaperino have you released a copy of the beautiful thank you card you sent me would you like to see it @ericbolling @kimguilfoyle
entrepreneurs brainpower is the ultimate leverage don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities
entrepreneurs be tough be smart be personable but don't take things personally that's good business
entrepreneurs negotiation is an art treat it like one
the senate must not pass tpa any senator who votes for it is disqualified for being potus protect the american worker and manufacturer
@jordanspieth great job you are a true champion see you soon

i want to thank elizabeth steve brian and all of the great folks of @foxandfriends for the long and successful run we had together nice
sadly i will no longer be doing @foxandfriends at 700 am on mondays this is because i am running for president and law prohibits love
@karlrove still thinks romney won he doesn't have a clue @foxnews
@karlrove stated clearly that he wants to repeal the 2nd amendment i thought @foxnews was going to fire that jerk after his romney fiasco
the great mike wallace covered me in a much more professional manner than his son chris wallace of @foxnews mike was a total pro
@martharaddatz was so unprofessional and biased when discussing me on this week @gstephanopoulos should not allow this conduct
@karlrove who spent $430 million in the last cycle and didn't win one race said i'm not a candidate until i file papers next week karl
who would you rather have negotiating for the us against putin iran china etc donald trump or hillary is there even a little doubt
thank you @anncoulter for your nice words the us is becoming a dumping ground for the world pols don't get it make america great again
my speech is right now on c span 1
druggies drug dealers rapists and killers are coming across the southern border when will the us get smart and stop this travesty
mexico is killing the united states economically because their leaders and negotiators are far smarter than ours but nobody beats trump
i like mexico and love the spirit of mexican people but we must protect our borders from people from all over pouring into the us
why did @danaperino beg me for a tweet (endorsement) when her book was launched
our country is in a major crisis of incompetent leadership we cannot continue to go on with these politicians who do nothing but talk
out of hundreds of deals and transactions i have used the bankruptcy laws a few times to make deals better nothing personal just business
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool icahn black zell but nobody says they went bankrupt
people buy deals and immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals it’s a very effective and commonly used business tool
stop saying i went bankrupt i never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage smart
has charles @krauthammer ever apologized for being so totally wrong on iraq i called it right in every way make america great again
george will was a big iraq fool $2 trillion thousands of lives lost and we got nothing dummy
goofy political pundit george will spoke at mar a lago years ago i didn’t attend because he’s boring and often wrong a total dope
@llambert0207 i've always said the country needs to be run like a major corporation it takes a brilliant businessman #power #donaldtrump
@thehickman33 let's get the trump trending #makeamericagreatagain #thedoniscoming #trumpcard #vets4trump
@williamonlyrent why is government run by politicians it's a huge business and needs a businessman to run it successfully #trump2016
just watched brian williams on @todayshow very sad brian should get on with a new life and not start all over at @msnbc stop apologizing
@justinborges1 trump 4 presidenthas a nice ring to it about time someone who isn't afraid to say/do what's necessary took the reigns
the tragedy in south carolina is incomprehensible my deepest condolences to all
only a fool would buy the @nydailynews loses fortune and has zero gravitas let it die
enjoyed watching @monicacrowley's analysis of my @billoreilly interview great points thank you monica

entrepreneurs do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail ralph waldo emerson
entrepreneurs focus on your goals not on fixed patterns do what's necessary and what's unnecessary will be made clear
entrepreneurs don’t sell yourself short don’t ever think you’ve done it all already or that you’ve done your best
entrepreneurs keep your eyes on your ideals as well as reality accentuate the positive without being blind to the negative
entrepreneurs review your work habits regularly and make sure they are taking you in the right direction keep your focus intact
entrepreneurs take responsibility for yourself it’s a very empowering attitude
entrepreneurs follow your own path it will bring you to the places you were meant to be
dee dee sorvino @deedeegop i am betting on trump

going to north carolina to make keynote speech sold out crowd
we must stop common core from controlling state and local curriculums it is a federal grab of education keep education local
china just hacked our federal government and stole gov workers’ information why do our leaders let china get away with this no respect
@gretchencarlson's memoir is a powerful example of perseverance and hope “getting real” is as real as it gets get it and enjoy #gettingreal
looking forward to keynoting the @ncgop #ncgopcon dinner tomorrow night @ncgop is a top state party
was in iowa yesterday great people record crowds at both speeches something big is happening pols are all talk make america great again
@krauthammer pretends to be a smart guy but if you look at his record he isn't a dummy who is on too many fox shows an overrated clown
one of the worst and most boring political pundits on television is @krauthammer a totally overrated clown who speaks without knowing facts
entrepreneurs vision remains vision until you focus do the work and bring it down to earth where it will do some good
re negotiation think about what the other side wants know where they're coming from view any conflict as an opportunity be flexible
entrepreneurs negotiation is an art treat it like one
just as i predicted while obama lifted sanctions 18 months ago iran cheated and increased its nuclear fuel by 20 percent we must double sanctions
excited to be returning to the @ncgop state convention as the keynote of saturday’s dinner @ncgop is a strong conservative state party
the trans pacific partnership will increase our trade deficits and send even more jobs overseas this is a bad deal time for smart trade
for those of you that have conveniently forgotten dummy jon stewart is a bad filmmaker his last effort was a real bomb (in all ways)
jon stewart is the most overrated joke on television a wiseguy with no talent not smart but convinces dopes he is fading out fast
i will be on @foxandfriends at 700 am enjoy
for those of you that have conveniently fotgotten dummy jon stewart is a bad filmmaker his last effort was a real bomb (in all ways)
i would like to offer vice president biden my warmest condolences on the loss of his wonderful son beau met him once great guy
all the haters and losers must admit that unlike others i never attacked dopey jon stewart for his phony last name would never do that
while jon stewart is a joke not very bright and totally overrated some losers and haters will miss him and his dumb clown humor too bad
jon stewart is the most overrated joke on television a wiseguy with no talent not smart but convinces dopes he is fading out fast
wow the economy is really bad gross domestic product down 07 percent in 1st quarter and getting worse i told you so only i can fix
entrepreneurs ask yourself what can i provide that does not yet exist be open to new ideas be innovative
entrepreneurs set the example you can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering that you are setting the example
entrepreneurs get and keep your momentum going without momentum a lot of great ideas go nowhere
common core is a federal takeover of school curriculum department of education should be disbanded not expanded focus on local education
in the end you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish
watch listen and learn you can't know it all yourself anyone who thinks they do is destined for mediocrity donald trump"
politicians are all talk and no action bush and rubio couldn't answer simple question on iraq they will never make america great again
good advice from my mother "trust in god and be true to yourself" mary trump
good advice from my father "know everything you can about what you're doing"  fred c trump
in business you make decisions that are in your best interests time for the us gov't to do the same let’s make america great again
resolve never to quit never to give up no matter what the situation jack nicklaus
a quote from the late great golfer sam snead "practice puts brains in your muscles" this is true also in life
will be doing @greta interview tomorrow so much to talk about
@anncoulter's new book "adios america the left's plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole" is a great read good job
entrepreneurs realize that persistence can go a long way being stubborn is often an attribute
entrepreneurs problems are a mind exercise enjoy the challenge
entrepreneurs see yourself as victorious look at the solution not the problem
if any candidate believes that with what we know today we still should have invaded iraq then they are unqualified to be commander in chief
whether you think you can or think you can't you are right henry ford
i will be going to trump links at ferry point for the official opening of this long delayed (but future nyc treasure) course great job "d"
the middle class has become the new poor in this country and our incompetent politicians are unable to do anything about itthey don't care
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 700 am

i told @megynkelly that @oreillyfactor and i had identical views on a certain issue and she cut it out of the taped interview why too bad
on this memorial day holiday we honor our fallen soldiers who have made the greatest sacrifice for freedom they are our country’s finest
if i run and if i win our country will be great again last line of my @srqrepublicans speech

marco rubio was a complete disaster today in an interview with chris wallace @foxnews concerning our invading iraqhe was as clueless as jeb

what would you do if a large group of muslims had a very public meeting drawing horrible and mocking cartoons of jesus oh really be cool
the us has enough problems without publicity seekers going out and openly mocking religion in order to provoke attacks and death be smart
nobody would fight harder for free speech than me but why taunt over and over again in order to provoke possible death to audience dumb
thrilled to hear that @rakutentraveljp has awarded @trumpwaikiki the 'rakuten diamond award' for the 4th consecutive year congrats

whether you think you can or think you can't you're right henry ford
entrepreneurs don't tread water get out there and go for it
entrepreneurs achievers move forward at all times achievement is not a plateau it's a beginning
if the working proud and productive people of our country don't start exerting their authority and views the us as we know it is doomed
why is no one talking about the horrible murder of ana charle by ex con thug west spruill gunned down on street naked why no riots here
billions of dollars spent on baltimore and it's still a total mess leadership is needed not dollars our whole country is going to hell
@cgasparino good seeing you keep up the great work never stop
congrats @trumpwaikiki for winning @americanexpress fine hotels and resorts 'hotel partner of the year for 2014' award
@nicolledwallace is really hurting @theview she is boring predictable and has zero television "it" show no longer has ratings dying
i have been a guest on the view many times when it was successful show now the show is dying for lack of ratings too bad
they now say using the word "thug" is like so many other words not politically correct (even though obama uses it) it is racist bull
thank you @trumpsoho @trumpnewyork for helping me celebrate #agreatcause @marinecorpslef while accepting the commandant’s leadership award
i am going to iowa today sold out crowds people don't want our country ripped off anymore must stop now
i wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the united states as they watch the disgusting and out of control baltimore riots
hopefully there won't be any problems in baltimore tonight be calm be cool do not let anybody get hurtthere is just too much to live for
the best social program by far is a job our jobs are being taken away from us by china and many other countries incompetent leader
president obama you have a big job to do go to baltimore and bring both sides together with proper leadership it can be done do it
our country has to come together we have to start working with and really liking each other the whole world is watching baltimore
the mayor of baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters "space to destroy" another real genius
now that the ineffective baltimore police have allowed the city to be destroyed are the us taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)
our great african american president hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying baltimore
blatant and rampant property destruction in baltimore as the police stand by and watch should be a lesson on how not to handle riots sad
wow 15 policemen hurt in baltimore some badly where is the national guard police must get tough and fast thugs must be stopped
nobody but donald trump will save israel you are wasting your time with these politicians and political clowns best #sheldonadelson

@johnhawkinsrwn great speaking to you today we will speak again soon
why are the republicans giving obama fast track authority for tpp and the iran agreement obama gets more from the gop than his own party
fact – while jeb was governor and rubio was house majority leader florida’s debt more than doubled conservatives
excited to be travelling to new hampshire on monday the granite state is a model for the country live free or die
@geraldorivera thanks my champion geraldo and very true
@rightjj; should definitely include you in the polls why exclude someone with real life experiences in running things successfully
do you notice that the polling establishment doesn't put me in polls but put in folks who hardly register make america great again
china has a backdoor into the trans pacific partnership this deal does not address currency manipulation china is laughing at us
the trans pacific partnership will lead to even greater unemployment do not pass it
republicans should not be giving obama fast track authority on trade the trans pacific partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector
the trans pacific partnership is an attack on america's business it does not stop japan's currency manipulation this is a bad deal
i want to negotiate my own and much better trade deals for our country must include currency manipulation (and more) do not let pass
congratulations to the republicans in congress you are the only people obama can out negotiate #timetogettough
i'm getting the commandant's leadership award from the usmarines tonight at the waldorf astoria a great honor @bretbaier
@nro @jonahnro wow just looked at the stats for national review dying fast doing very little business save this conservative voice
the reason ed schultz said nice things about me is that i’m the only repub who won't cut social security etc i’ll make america rich again
i’m a conservative but the weakness of conservatives is that they destroy each other whereas liberals unite to win
with a stupid guy like jonah goldberg who uses “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” to hit me no wonder the nro is doing so poorly @jonahnro
people have been forced to resign positions for far less than @jonahnro’s “tweeting like a 14 year old girl”
@jonahnro you stated that i started “relentlessly tweeting like a 14 year old girl” horrible insult to women resign now or later
republicans have once again capitulated to obama this time on the iran nuclear treaty when will it end
@ronniewnichol just viewed the video of the changes to @turnberrybuzz an already stunning course will now be even more spectacular

@stephenfhayes i heard you were a joke on the media panel this weekend in new hampshire you just don't have what it takes @joenbc
national review @nro may be going out of business because of the really pathetic job being done by @jonahnro no talent means death sad
@megynkelly sorry there was only one "breakout star" this weekend in new hampshire just check out the local new hampshire media
jonah goldberg @jonahnro of the once great @nro #national review is truly dumb as a rock why does @bretbaier put this dummy on his show
as i have long been saying south africa is a total and very dangerous mess just watch the evening news (when not talking weather)
we are stupidly paying iran billions of dollars that we should not be paying why isn't this part of the nuclear negotiations really dumb
we are getting ready to protect saudi arabia against iran and others sending ships how much are they going to pay us toward this protection
congratulations to @trumpsoho for once again receiving the aaa five diamond award for another year
congratulations to @trumpwaikiki for being selected as "best of +vip access 2014" by @expedia
@weeklystandard i know your business is failing but you should try to get writers far better than @stephenfhayes

@georgewillf is perhaps the most boring political pundit on television got thrown off abc like a dog at mar a lago he was a total bust
i do what i do out of pure enjoyment hopefully nobody does it better theres a beauty to making a great deal it's my canvas
@bretbaier why do you have george will on your show he's exhausted boring and not even a little relevant waste of good air time

kimguilfoyle great job tonight
jeb bush “i am a conservative” = barack obama “if you like your healthcare plan you can keep your plan”
america will never be destroyed from the outsideif we falter and lose our freedomsit will be because we destroyed ourselves a lincoln
mexico’s court system is a dishonest joke i am owed a lot of money and nothing happens
rodolfo rosas moya and his pals in mexico owe me a lot of money disgusting and slow mexico court system mexico is not a us friend

many journalists are honest and great but some are knowingly dishonest and basic scum they shouldbe weeded out

i'm looking forward to the super bowl but looking even more forward to monday night at 800 best episode ever of celebrity apprentice
i hope you can go to @oreillyfactor and vote for donald trump in order to make america great again thanks
whether you think you can or think you can't you're right henry ford
now that mitt is gone all we have to do is get bush to drop out and trump to run and we will win
when i broadly proclaimed mitt “choked” – and would do it again everybody said yeah he’s right
i will take full credit for mitt romney dropping out of the race looks like he won’t be endorsing trump any time soon
mitt did the right thing not because he had to but because he never would have been given a second chance after his first fiasco
everyone is saying the bad news is that donald trump is going to take credit and they are right mitt wouldn’t have won anyway

so many people have told me that i should host meet the press and replace the moron who is on now just too busy especially next 10 years
apprentice = big hit miss universe = big hit i always get big ratings if i hosted meet the press instead of sleepy eyesa smash @nbcnews
i am convinced that sleepy eyes chuck todd was only a placeholder for someone else at meet the press he bombed franchise in ruins @nbc
president obama our great leader wants to declare martial law in new york city as a means of helping out with the "massive" storm
wow the final ratings for the miss universe pageant show that it won in all key demos number one on sunday i have a winner

almost no news organizations are showing the "satirical" pictures gee i wonder why the media is usually so brave
i would like to thank @golfmagazine for the really nice review of trump national doral best renovation of the year (and maybe all time)
remember when guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns

if the people so violently shot down in paris had guns at least they would have had a fighting chance

in the end you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish
without passion you don't have energy without energy you have nothing find work that you love and the energy will be there
if you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure stop trying to balance them instead make your work more pleasurable
what separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate
sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war
where’s the electability jeb is losing to hrc by 13 points a bush will never beat a clinton wake up @gop
@coachdanmullen great to have you and your great team at trump national doral go out and finish your fantastic season in style
if you can’t see it it will never happen bring your vision to fruition through perseverance and hard work that will build momentum
sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make
if you're going to be thinking you may as well think big
deals are my art form other people paint beautifully or write poetry i like making deals preferably big deals that's how i get my kicks
can the relationship between the mayor of new york city and the police force ever be fixed tune in to @foxandfriends at 715

so many people think i will not run for presidentwow i wonder what the response will be if i do even the haters and losers will be happy
dummy bill maher did an advertisement for the failing new york times where the picture of him is very sad he looks pathetic bloated and gone
negotiation is an art treat it like one
entrepreneurs absorb assess and then act don't negate your own power whatever you've been dealt know you can deal with it
entrepreneurs realize that fear is the exact opposite of faith resolve to be bigger than your problems who's the boss
entrepreneurs whatever happens you're responsible if it doesn't happen you're responsible

should have settled … ft lauderdale plaintiffs must pay me close to $400k in legal fees after trump trial victory
pigs get slaughtered … again ft lauderdale plaintiffs must pay me close to $400k in legal fees after trump trial victory
the movie may be garbage but we can’t let a foreign country dictate to us what to watch @sonypictures
amy pascal of sony was totally used by rev al sharpton she should be fired for stupidity
will be interviewed tonight at 7 by @greta re sony and bush
i'll be co hosting @extratv tonight be sure to tune in
after destroying the middle east and our economy the bushes last gift was having justice roberts legalize obamacare no more bushes
i can’t believe the great @wjcarter got canned by @nytimes he was a fantastic reporter and really knew entertainment he will be missed
success is not final failure is not fatal it is the courage to continue that counts winston churchill
obama has admitted that he spends his mornings watching @espn then he plays golf fundraises and grants amnesty to illegals
obama attacks the cia for waterboarding while routinely droning civilians caught in the islamist crosshairs
the last thing this country needs is another bush
how many more times do we all have to watch and pay for that stupid and never ending #smokeybearhug commercial how much is govt spending
the cia deserves our praise for taking the fight to the enemy in the dark corners of the world the cia perseveres the politicians whine
i will be on @foxandfriends at 700 in 10 minutes have a great day all
no wonder sony is doing so badly really stupid leadership that wants al sharpton to help watch him turn the tables on chief amy pascal
can you believe that sony chief amy pascal wants to meet with al sharpton to seek forgiveness for her racial slurs al is laughing at her
the jets should have let them score to get the number one draft pick who will be really good it will just never change for them
isn't it interesting that immediately after september 11th everybody was asking for and indeed demanding torture of any kind no reports
when terrorists are beheading and executing american citizens in such a brutal waythe report on torture should be the least of our concerns
the terrorists cut off the heads of americans and laugh then want to sell us the bodies for $1000000 we fight over sleep deprivation
these islamists chop americans’ heads off and want to destroy us we should be applauding the cia not persecuting them
if america was under the threat of imminent attack would obama use torture or a kiss
policy towards our enemies hit them hard hit them fast hit them often and then tell them it was because they are the enemy
obama and democrat leaders did a great disservice by releasing the papers on torture the world is laughing at us they think we are fools
i will miss @letterman and doing his show he was always intriguing and smart you never knew what would happen  but he was fair
entrepreneurs cover your bases know everything you can about what you're doing then go with your gut your instincts r there for a reason
entrepreneurs see yourself as victorious look at the solution not the problem and never give up
entrepreneurs view any conflict as an opportunity being positive could lead you into a fortunate situation
conde nast made a big mistake going into the world trade center the place is a total disaster and i feel this is only the beginning
people are really unhappy with the endless security checks at the new world trade center durst is a terrible manager tenants furious
durst is a disaster at operating the new world trade center it takes forever for workers or visitors to get in with impossible security
romneycare/obamacare architect gruber apologized for his comments he should apologize for the $2t monstrosity and return all taxpayer money
president obama gruber and all of the other obama cronies got obamacare passed by lies and fraudulent statements courts should overturn
glad to see romneycare/obamacare architect gruber being eviscerated on the hill today he should return all taxpayer money he was paid
obamacare continues to increase insurance premiums and raise record deductibles new congress must use every tool to defund
very sad and dangerous that soon to be ex intelligence chair dianne feinstein released the cia report glad she is losing her comm chair
we're missing a lot of information on autism support @autismspeaks' project by visiting mssng #mssng
sorry @rosie is a mentally sick woman a bully a dummy and above all a loser other than that she is just wonderful
@golfmagazine is great thanks
thank you @golfmagazine for your fantastic review of the blue monster at trump national doral "best us resort renovation" and "all time"
wow @golfmagazine just rated the renovation of the blue monster the best of the year even better they stated it may be best of all time
our country and our "leaders" are getting dumber all the time now they are about to release full documentation on torture will destroy cia
when you have exhausted all possibilities remember this you haven't  thomas a edison
congratulations to @billcassidy on a decisive win this past saturday bill will be a pro growth and pro energy senator
the cia report should not be released puts our agents and military overseas in danger a propaganda tool for our enemies
they should close down rolling stone magazine after the phony rape charge story university of virginia should sue them for big bucks
i'll be on @foxandfriends this morning at 700 so much to talk about
entrepreneurs believe in yourself if you don't no one else will either
entrepreneurs you have to have passion if you love your work success will follow
i never gave anybody hell i just told the truth and they thought it was hell harry s truman
congress must pass a budget and hold obama to it no more continuing resolutions and no more excuses republicans soon hold both houses
brainpower is the ultimate leverage keep your focus intact
young entrepreneurs your success is measured by results be productive in the face of challenges setbacks are not fatal
so sad that burt reynolds has lost all of his money i wish he came to me for advice he would be rich as hell
if obamacare should not be repealed then why has obama and congress exempted their staffs
obama is community organizing from the oval office on ferguson today more riots sure to follow
congress’ greatest card against obama is the power of the purse use it
now obama is keeping our soldiers in afghanistan for at least another year he is losing two wars simultaneously
@whoopigoldberg don’t let @rosie speak badly of you or try to bring you down she is rude crude and not smart she is not in your league
congratulations to @nycparks on quickly repairing the lasker rink record skaters this past thanksgiving
rosie o’donnell went after me again on the view in order to stir up her failing ratings nothing will help her @rosie always fails
ratings way down show irrelevant why haven't they learned @rosie always fails
the usga boy's junior champion at trump national golf club bedminster just won the australian open we are proud of you @jordanspieth
bill cosby is foolish stupid or getting bad advice in remaining silent if he is innocent probably guilty not a fan
why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in ferguson at 900 in the evening a prime time for riots not smart
iran and the united states just pushed deadline back seven months on working out a nuclear deal iran is tapping along our bad negotiators
isis is starting its own currency may be stronger than the dollar if obamacare is fully implemented
there is no excuse for riots in ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome
fact – amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform
premiering on january 4th the 14th season of @apprenticenbc will have major fireworks every episode the board room is electric
congratulations to chuck hagel on one of the shortest tenures as sec of defense another terrible appointee by obama
defense sechagel has quit great news for our country the guy didn’t have a clue grossly outmatched by our enemies couldn't even speak
tom brady played great today he is a total champ and a really nice guy a rare combination
do you think the 14 african nations that are banning west africans from coming into their nations are racist
@aaronschock aaron it was great to meet you at trump tower also really good job on television
congratulations to bill o’brien on being named the republican speaker of the nh house well earned and well deserved a great guy
entrepreneurs keep your momentum without momentum a lot of great ideas go nowhere
entrepreneurs problems are a mind exercise enjoy the challenge
if you really want to succeed you'll have to go for it every day the big time isn't for slackers keep up your stamina and remain curious
they're going to riot in ferguson no matter what
you don't necessarily need the best location what you need is the best deal the art of the deal
if we do not protect the rule of law then we can expect even more illegals to cross the border obama’s executive amnesty is dangerous
iraq should be paying us while we fight isis give the money to the families of our brave soldiers
i enjoyed meeting with @mattblunt @trumptowerny to discuss why our government must address currency manipulation many us jobs are at stake
repubs must not allow pres obama to subvert the constitution of the us for his own benefit and because he is unable to negotiate w/ congress
i am no fan of bill cosby but never the less some free advice if you are innocent do not remain silent you look guilty as hell
if you don’t publicize your successes your competitors will be sure to belittle them get the word out
for those that constantly say that “global warming” is now “climate change” they changed the name the name global warming wasn’t working
@blakehoagland what is the best advice you could give to a young entrepreneur mr trump you have to be passionate about your work
there are many jonathan gruber types selling the global warming "stuff" and they really do believe the american public is stupid
entrepreneurs always remember that deals are fluid terms are always negotiable and time can be the best option for success
obamacare will continue to stop entrepreneurship slow growth and halt research and development defund repeal and replace
at least obamacare/romneycare architect gruber admitted albeit privately that we were lied to by obama gang of liars
congratulations to @sixteenchicago @trumpchicago for being honored with a @michelinguidechi two star rating again this year
just like jonathan gruber viciously lied and called americans “stupid” on obamacare many consultants are doing the same on global warming
obama’s china ‘climate’ deal binds america with language of ‘will’ curb emissions now while china only ‘intends’ to curb in 2030 bad deal
obamacare/romneycare architect gruber was paid over $6m with our tax dollars yet obama only claims he ‘was some adviser’
deportations are now at a record low obama manipulated the numbers to lie to the public that they were at a record high secure the border
i will be on @foxandfriends in ten minutes enjoy
the entire country is freezing we desperately need a heavy dose of global warming and fast ice caps size reaches all time high
i will be on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 700 will be talking about sleazebag jonathan gruber ("americans are stupid") and exec order
 #laskerrink we do not do the maintenance on lasker rink that is done by new york city
so obama's top people responsible for obamacare think the american public is stupid all based on lies and deception repubs should sue
looking forward to addressing @theeconomicclub on december 15th at the marriot marquis washington dc
@ryan5240 after playing the new course in aberdeen and loved it my wife taking me to turnberry for a birthday present on monday great

entrepreneurs set the example you can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering you are setting the example
entrepreneurs see yourself as victorious look at the solution not the problem keep your focus positive
obama’s attack on the internet is another top down power grab net neutrality is the fairness doctrine will target conservative media

@foxandfriends in five minutes enjoy
i will be doing @foxandfriends at 800 am
remember we don't get any oil from iraq china gets whatever isis hasn't already taken so why isn't china sending the troops too smart
do not go back into iraq unless they agree in a signed formal instrument to give the us 50 percent of their oil reservesmake the deal dummies
we spent two trillion dollars in iraq and got nothing now we are going back and will again get nothing because our leaders are clueless
we are now sending thousands of additional troops to iraq to teach them how to fight they will run billions wasted what does us get
we should immediately stop sending our beautiful american tax dollars to countries that hate us and laugh at our president’s stupidity

@judgejeanine tonight at 9 pm on @foxnews enjoy
they finally let our marine out of a mexican prison no thanks to obama way too long such an event should never be allowed to happen again
the five prisoners our government so stupidly released for one pathetic traitor are now fighting and killing for isis bad deal courtmarshal
having a truly great imagination is often far more important than having even massive knowledge but still never underestimate knowledge
crazy election officials saying that there is nothing stopping illegal immigrants from voting this is very bad (unfair) for republicans
next tuesday remember how our president has not lifted a finger for usmc tahmooressi he only wants illegals to cross our border

i told you that the giants starting hudson was a mistake just got knocked out of the game i love being right
entrepreneurs keep an open mind business is a creative endeavor there are always opportunities and possibilities
entrepreneurs look at the solution not the problem learn to focus on what will give results
obama will quarantine all soldiers returning from africa for 21 days but he still allows all who contract ebola into country hypocrite
obama admin called @netanyahu "chickenshit" ironic since bibi was an idf special forces commando while obama was a community organizer
in game 7 of the world series tonight the giants are making a big mistake in not starting their ace against kc even with two days rest
just out the polar ice caps are at an all time high the polar bear population has never been stronger where the hell is global warming
the us rocket that blew up and crashed yesterday is emblematic of the united states under obama nothing works be it a rocket or website
president obama strongly considering a plan to bring non us citizens with ebola to the united states for treatment now i know he's nuts
watch me on @seanhannity's show at 10pm tonight on @foxnews
success requires 100 percent of your focus and 100 percent of your effort don't sell yourself short
keep your momentum without momentum a lot of great ideas go nowhere
mark udall was the deciding vote for obamacare and now 250000 coloradans were dropped from their plans vote @corygardner
john foust is a liberal who supports obamacare and opposes ebola travel ban send conservative @barbaracomstock to congress
all the governors are already backing off of the ebola quarantines bad decision that will lead to more mayhem
wh refused a meeting with the israeli defense minister if only obama hated iran as much as he dislikes israel
obamacare has brought skyrocketing premium increases and unaffordable deductibles which will lead to less care and job losses
achievers move forward at all times achievement is not a plateau it's a beginning don't waste time treading water
congratulations @trump_ireland for being named #12 resort in europe by the @cntraveler #readerschoice2014 awards
6 @trumpcollection hotels made @cntraveler reader’s choice @trumpnewyork @trumpsoho @trumpchicago @trumptoronto @trumppanama @trump_ireland

fox and friends going on now enjoy
will be on @foxandfriends at 700 (30 minutes) a great deal to talk about including ebola quarantine
there are just so many penalties and such long commercials in these nfl games that they are no longer worth watching soft hitting and boring
i would absolutely consider investing in atlantic city again great and hard working people but much would have to change taxes regs etc
yes i won the right to have my name taken off trump plaza in ac because it was not operated up to a very high standard and no involvement
i made a fortune in atlantic city got out years ago (great timing) and havn't been back in many years i have nothing to do with ac
with all that is happening with ebola including the doctor who so easily came back to new york obama still refuses to stop the flights
there is zero margin for error on ebola are we confident in obama when he can’t even make a website for $5 billion
michelle nunn supports amnesty a weak border and obamacare she is an obama liberal send dc an independent voice vote @perduesenate
canadian pm harper immediately called the ottawa attack terrorism at least north america has a strong leader who lives in reality
the ebola doctor who just flew to ny from west africa and went on the subway bowling and dining is a very selfish man should have known
president obama you are a complete and total disaster but you have a chance to do something great and important stop the flights
president obama has a major meeting on the nyc ebola outbreak with people flying in from all over the country but decided to play golf
i never thought i'd say it in my lifetime but president barack hussein obama aka barry sotoro is a far worse president than jimmy carter
i have been saying for weeks for president obama to stop the flights from west africa so simple but he refused a total incompetent
ebola has been confirmed in nyc with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact withobama's fault
if this doctor who so recklessly flew into new york from west africahas ebolathen obama should apologize to the american people and resign
there is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in west africa and who flew into new york has ebola touched many bedlam
double digit premium increases because of obamacare dems trying to delay showing numbers until after election but news is spreading fast
tremendous pressure on president obama to institute a travel ban on ebola stricken west africa at some point this stubborn dope will fold
alison grimes supports harsh restrictions to kill coal industry and supports obama's anti gun legislation vote @team_mitch
liberal sd dem candidate rick weiland wants to expand obamacare to single payer and opposes ebola travel ban send @roundsforsenate to senate
if mitt romney were in the private sector and he suffered the horrendous loss of 2012 do you think he’d rehire himself for 2016 i don’t
later today i’m being honored at the park hyatt in washington dc by the wharton club the joseph wharton award dinner a great honor
ben bradlee was truly one of the greats what an amazing life he led my warmest condolences to dino and the whole family #benbradlee
i'm going to dc today to check on the hotel i'm building on penn ave and then being honored by the wharton school of finance the best
why are we letting the three girls who left the us to join isis back into the country how stupid has our once respected country become
if there is one more ebola case in the us a full travel ban will be instituted this common sense move should have been done long ago
the united states troops which were sent to west africa have only gotten 4 hours of ebola training very unfair to them and their families
the united states under president obama has truly become the "gang that couldn't shoot straight" everything he touches turns to garbage
the us accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of isis as enemy laughs very sad
negotiation is an art treat it like one
don’t believe kay hagan on ebola travel ban she also promised that you would keep your healthcare plan under obamacare vote @thomtillis
obama will let ebola fly into us and drugrunners cross our border daily but he won't pressure mexico on sgt tahmooressi #freeourmarine
i will be in washington dc tomorrow to receive the 2014 joseph wharton award at the wharton club of dc a great honor @wharton
oscar pistorious will likely only serve 10 months for the cold blooded murder of his girlfriend another oj travestythe judge is a moron
wow one of the all time greats in fashion oscar de la renta has just died at 82 great fashion achievements but also a really nice guy
oscar pistorius only gets five years in prison for killing his girlfriend ridiculous decision judge couldn't even read her own writings
has everyone forgotten our marine who now sits in a mexican prison because we have a president too incompetent or too lazy to make a call
congratulations to @trumpcollection’s @trumppanama for receiving the certificate of excellence and top 10 hotels in panama from @tripadvisor
congrats to @trumpwaikiki for being named @orbitz best in stay elite award winner for oahu for 2014
@agschneiderman must take a drug test immediately make results public ny attorney general cannot be a cokehead
i was never a fan of bush in fact he was so bad he gave us obama but obama is truly a pathetic excuse of a president can't get any worse
i will be on @foxandfriends at 700 45 minutes talking about ebola obama and other strange us happenings
i just returned from iowa what a beautiful state the people are amazing and the event for congressman steve king was a great success
do you believe obama just said that america would be "less safe" with a travel ban from west africathis is the thinking of a total mad man
the lobbyist and political hack that president obama just appointed as the "ebola czar" just missed his first major meeting on ebola a joke
i'm leaving for iowa now will be great
if i were president sgt andrew tahmooressi would be let out of jail with one phone call if notmexico would pay a price like never before
do you think the 14 african nations that are banning west africans from coming into their nations are being called racists perhaps not
14 african nations have totally banned west africans from entering their nations likewise many other nations but the us = "come on in"
obama just appointed an ebola czar with zero experience in the medical area and zero experience in infectious disease control a total joke
if you can’t see it you can’t make it happen entrepreneurs chase your dreams with resolute focus and determination be positive
now michelle nunn will not admit she voted for obama of course she did nunn supports obamacare and is anti second amendment
the new ebola czar will report to the wh and nsa adviser susan rice more mismanagement and duplicity with cdc obama is terrible executive
@yusiddiqui @piersmorgan @rustyrockets i got much better no contest i got melania
@piersmorgan russell has nothing going for himself except for energy and aggression without that he would be dead a first class dummy
very excited to be returning to iowa tomorrow to campaign for my friend and strong conservative leader @stevekingia
i love seeing that graydon carter and @vanityfair are failing so badly he’s only focused on his bad food restaurants
looks like obama will not stop the very potentially dangerous flights to and from west africa what the hell is wrong with this guy
@katyperry i watched russell brand and i think his mind is fried he looks really bad russell is a total joke a dummy who is lost
@katyperry katy what the hell were you thinking when you married loser russell brand there is a guy who has got nothing going a waste
@katyperry must have been drunk when she married russell brand @rustyrockets – but he did send me a really nice letter of apology
i watched russell brand @rustyrockets on the @jimmyfallon show the other night what the hell do people see in russell a major loser
the ebola nurse should never have been allowed to fly to cleveland and (amazing) back again nothing works in our once great country anymore
i am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with president obama's mental health why won't he stop the flights psycho
it is time for the airline pilots flight attendants and the airlines themselves to stop flights to and from west africa do it right now
i just had a great victory against lightweight ag eric schneiderman most of his case re trump u was thrown out or gutted little remains
i can't believe that mitt romney would run for president again he had his chance and blew it in the last weeks of the race
a nurse in dallas who treated ebola patient thomas duncan was allowed to fly to cleveland she should never have been so allowed the real jv
with all of the words president obama just dispensed at his press conference he didn't say what we all want to hear"i'll stop the flights"
young entrepreneurs – always remember in negotiations that sometimes the best deal you make is the one you walk away from
our president could not make a proper website with $5b the website still does not work how can we feel safe about ebola
looking forward to returning to the hawkeye state this saturday to support my friend and strong conservative @stevekingia
lightweight @agschneiderman is driving business and jobs out of ny only wants self publicity a total loser
john @cahillforag is one of the most respected people in politics dopey @agschneiderman is one of the least respected
president obama has a personal responsibility to visit and embrace all people in the us who contract ebola
obama still refuses to stop the flights is he stubborn or just plain incompetent i say both
it's tuesday @agschneiderman is wearing revlon eyeliner today governor cuomo alerted all to this
michelle nunn will be a solid vote for obama she supports obamacare and opposes 2nd amendment vote for @perduesenate to change things
we pay for obama's travel so he can fundraise millions so democrats can run on lies then we pay for his golf
alison grimes will protect the 'sanctity' of her obama ballot yet admits she voted for hillary in primary hypocrite vote @team_mitch
if you want more you have to require more from yourself dr phil mcgraw
as isis and ebola spread like wildfire the obama administration just submitted a paper on how to stop climate change (aka global warming)
can you believe that with all of the problems and difficulties facing the us president obama spent the day playing golfworse than carter
if you never want to be criticized for goodness' sake don't do anything new jeff bezos
if alison grimes can’t admit she voted for obama even if she is embarrassed then you can’t trust her vote @team_mitch
the military generals are fuming at obama he has boxed them in against isis with a strategy that is destined to fail sad
happy belated birthday to chris wallace chris does a great job every week on @foxnewssunday like father like son
just finished reading a poorly written and very boring book on the general motors building by vicky ward waste of time @wileybiz
think of this after we spent $2 trillion on iraq baghdad is about to be taken over by isis
the @nfl games are so boring now that actually i’m glad i didn’t get the bills boring games too many flags too soft
even though i refused to pay a ridiculous price for the buffalo bills i would have produced a winner now that won’t happen
the people of buffalo should be happy terry pegula got the team but i hope he does better w/the bills than he has w/the sabres good luck
wow china exports rise 15 percent in september they are laughing at usa
@foxandfriends in 15 minutes
are nfl games getting boring or is it just my magnificent imagination in any event i'm just not watching them much anymore
i will be on fox and friends tomorrow morning at 700 ebola and isis will be topics
i don't know if president obama isn't stopping the flights from ebola torn west africa because he is stubborn stupid or just doesn't care
here we go a healthcare worker who treated thomas duncan the man who flew into the us from west africa infected with ebola caught it
president obama now bring our 4000 innocent and ill trained soldiers home from west africa before it is too late and stop the flights
remember when i said when saddam hussein fell the new leader of iraq will be meaner and tougher and hate the us even more welcome isis
if a conservative republican made the mistake that mrs obama just made by calling braley by the wrong name it would be the biggest story
michelle obama made a terrible mistake in iowa when endorsing bruce braley before a large crowd she called him bruce bailey seven times
isn't it ridiculous starting today new ebola screenings go into effect for people coming from west africa just stop the flights dummies
i've never seen anything like it everything he touches turns to gold so nice a quote by fred ctrump about his son donald (me)
do you notice that because of ebola isis etc obamacare has gone to the back burner despite horrible results coming out a disaster
obama “i will control ebola” = obama “if you like your health care plan you can keep your healthcare plan”
wow @nfl ratings are down big league glad i didn't get the bills rather be lucky than good
the @nfl ratings continue to fall every week and will keep dropping boring games too many flags too soft
the only reason i bid on @buffalobills was to make sure they stayed in buffalo where they belong mission accomplished
sweat equity is the most valuable equity there is know your business and industry better than anyone else in the world @mcuban
@agschneiderman should remove his eyeliner as pointed out by cuomo when he does his commercials
lightweight @agschneiderman will probably win only because he is a dem in ny but what a loser
lightweight @agschneiderman the worst attorney general in the us is in a tough election with john cahill @cahillforag
obamacare puts poor people on a form of government run single payer health insurance that many doctors don't take @avik
obama is making the ebola problem much worse than it needs to be in the us by not halting flights from west africa airport testing a joke
if you are interested in balancing work and pleasure you will never succeed
i feel sorry for the 4000 soldiers who are being forced to go the west africa to fight ebola their families are up in arms not trained
tens of millions of dollars in airstrikes had no impact because key leaders fled after hearing on news reports the strikes were coming dumb
china is ripping wealth out africa and yet as usual refuses to put anything back to help with ebola "let the stupid americans do it" sad
the residential real estate market continues to provide opportunities for first time home owners buy now if you can
the cdc chief just said ebola is spreading faster than aids marines are preparing for a pandemic drill stop all flights from west africa
obama won’t send troops to fight jihadists yet sends them to liberia to contract ebola he is a delusional failure
congratulations to @piersmorgan on his new position as editor at large for the united states of @mailonline my apprentice champ
i have to admit @alexsalmond is a tough smart guy he is formidable by any standard
right now 4000 us troops are stupidly heading to west africa to help fight ebolano help from china russia or wealthy african oil nations
the us is spending fortunes at airports checking people coming in from west africa with uncertain results stop the flights you dumb b's
in a little reported event china has just overtaken the united states as the number one world economic power great going washington
even jimmy carter just released a statement saying that obama doesn't have a clue that has to be a new low
obama stop the flights to and from west africa now before it is too late can't you see what's happening can you be that thick (stupid)
can you believe this fool dr thomas frieden of cdc just stated "anyone with fever should be asked if they have been in west africa" dope
any american who fights with isis should have their passport revoked take them to gitmo for interrogation
the fight against isis starts at our border ‘at least’ 10 isis have been caught crossing the mexico border build a wall
china has just overtaken us as the world’s largest economy we are busy wasting $'s while china builds airports and skyscrapers
entrepreneurs see yourself as victorious look at the solution not the problem
isis is advancing even against obama’s airstrikes obama is disengaged and making the middle east even more dangerous
obamacare premiums continue to rise and bend up the cross curve and the back end of the website does not even work
obama is looking like an incompetent fool in the handling of the war againstisis why isn't china and russia helping they gain so much
i was relentless because more often than you would think sheer persistence is the difference between success and failure never give up
real estate taxes are far too high @briarcliffmanor westchester a total joke how they waste money replace mayor vescio
when will mayor vescio and manager zegarelli repave pine road in @briarcliffmanor it is a disgrace
be sure to enjoy the ‘50th anniversary chicago international film festival’ at @trumpchicago the windy city’s top hotel
usmc andrew tahmooressi should be freed immediately he never should have been jailed in the first place weak leaders #freeourmarine
looking forward to being @trumpsoho this evening for corporate meeting planners reception for trump national doral @trumpdoral
congratulations @jean_georgesnyc for 10 years of 3 #michelinstars visit the restaurant in @trumpnewyork for a meal you’ll never forget
just put in ad for a real estate executive “hard work low pay mean boss”
despite the ever increasing ebola disaster obama refuses to stop flights from west africait's almost like he's saying f you to us public
obama has missed 58 percent of his intelligence briefings but our president does make 100 percent of his fundraisers
i will be on on the record @gretawire tonight at 7 pm
@scotgolfpodcast work has not yet begun we're in the approval phase it will be amazing you will love the final result
do you think crooked @agschneiderman will ever challenge the nfl tax status no too many friends and contributors in @nfl
i will be on fox and friends (@foxandfriends) at 700 fighting ebola will be a topic
i'm not going to be watching much nfl football anymore too time consuming too boring too many flags and too soft focus on other things
what the hell is obama doing in allowing all of these potentially very sick people to continue entering the us is he stupid or arrogant
i don't know what it is but i'm getting totally bored watching nfl football too many penalties and far too soft tv off and back to work
the jets just don't have it time for a quarterback change
president obama i have an idea pretend that west africa is israel and then you will be able to stop the ebola area flights
president obama close down the flights from ebola infected areas right now before it is too late what the hell is wrong with you
something very important and indeed society changing may come out of the ebola epidemic that will be a very good thing no shaking hands
this ebola patient thomas duncan who fraudulently entered the us by signing false papers is causing havoc if he lives prosecute
if ebola is so non contagious how come an nbc cameraman caught it so quickly while over in west africa us is behaving very foolishly
can you believe that president obama still hasn't stopped the flights and people pouring into the us from west africa terrible president
saw michael jordan and ray allen today playing golf at trump national doral the blue monster great guys
ebola patient duncan lied on his exit papers by saying he never came into contact with a person with ebola he knew he did and person died
how incompetent are our leaders allowing these ebola infected people to come into our country with all of the problems and danger entailed
the ebola patient who came into our country knew exactly what he was doing came into contact with over 100 peoplehere we go i told you so
the brand new hotel at trump national doral has the most beautiful rooms and suites in miami enjoy
i just arrived at trump national doral in miami where i'll spend the day checking work just completed by contractors this place is amazing
ebola is much easier to transmit than the cdc and government representatives are admitting spreading all over africa and fast stop flights
we have millions in our country unemployed yet we are wasting millions arming syrian ‘rebels’ what is wrong with washington
obama can attend a fundraiser every day but can’t be bothered to get briefed on national security commander in chief
our national security starts at the border do you think isis and al qaeda are just in the middle east
how is abc television allowed to have a show entitled "blackish" can you imagine the furor of a show "whiteish" racism at highest level
stop flights into the us from west africa immediately
the woman who is the secret service director looks like she is way over her headwhy can't the president appoint the best and the brightest
@calebccooper reading donaldtrump's the art of the deal" for my entrepreneurship class so many cool stories and business lessons to learn
the united states must immediately institute strong travel restrictions or ebola will be all over the united states a plague like no other
how dumb is our president to send thousands of poorly trained and ill equipped soldiers over to west africa to fight ebola stop all flights
here we go i stated long ago that we should cancel all flights from west africa now we have ebola in us and it will only get worse
president obama should stay out of the hong kong protests we have enough problems in our own countrycan't even properly police white house
success seems to be connected with action successful people keep moving they make mistakes but they don't quit conrad hilton
fact obama does not read his intelligence briefings nor does he get briefed in person by the cia or dod too busy i guess
keep your momentum without momentum a lot of great ideas go nowhere
i've realized that success requires 100 percent effort and 100 percent focus nothing less get out there and go for it
jeanne shaheen wants amnesty for illegals placed the deciding vote for obamacare and opposes the 2nd amendment vote her out in november
obama“i will destroy isis” = obama “if you like your healthcare plan you can keep your plan”

the animal who beheaded the woman in oklahoma should be given a very fast trial and then the death penalty the same fate beheading

i’ll bet if i didn’t harass apple for the last 2 years about the large screen iphone they wouldn’t have done it but it bends and breaks
when you’re in a fight with a bully always throw the first punch and don’t telegraph it hit hard and hit fast
the us should not be giving away our strategy and tactics to the enemy so they can prepare just go and do what you have to do
happy new year to all my jewish friends celebrating the holiday
someone unknown tweeted incorrectly that i'm for sen mitch @mcconnellpress for speaker i'm supporting him for senate majority leader
zegarelli and vescio pine road looks like hell must be re paved now very bad for town @briarcliffmanor
according to many isis was given so much time and so many signals as to when we would start bombing that they were able to prepare and hide
why would the people of kentucky want a rookie senator– they have sen mitch @mcconnellpress who may be next leader and bring $’s to ky
now obama is having our army coordinate with iran against isis what’s next
obama’s rollout of his isis war plan is another unmitigated disaster the generals must be furious
briarcliff manor mayor vescio is doing a terrible job taxes way too high roads in terrible condition repave pine road @briarcliffmanor
good morning i will be on fox and friends at 700 (30 minutes) enjoy @foxandfriends
the nfl should have its non profit status immediately revoked while at the same time ending the giant tax scam which makes teams so valuable
the nfl image is really tarnished now if the sponsors start leaving and the ratings go down the nfl will be in big trouble boring games
they just called this the biggest scandal in us sports history (gma) roger looks really weak and indecisive must put on a better front
what separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate
do you believe that obama is giving weapons to "moderate rebels" in syriaisn't sure who they are what the hell is he doingwill turn on us
why are we sending thousands of ill trained soldiers into ebola infested areas of africa bring the plague back to us obama is so stupid
roger goodell must stop apologizing to everyone who will listen and toughen up his street smart players are laughing at him and the nfl
brand new selection of trump signature collection shirts and ties @macys go check them out
the wilson family should thank me pegula overpaid for the @buffalobills because of me
leading by 13 over landrieu in a @foxnews poll @billcassidy will beat her in november
china's the leading exporter of iraqi oil yet they won’t lift a finger against isis why should we do the heavy lifting for china’s gain

congratulations to georgina bloomberg on winning the inaugural central park grand prix csi 3* @mikebloomberg
i am convinced that if @alexsalmond had not pushed ugly wind turbines all over scotland the vote would have been much better for him
the people of scotland have spoken a great decision i wish @alexsalmond well and look forward to playing golf with him at aberdeen
learn work and think in equal proportions and you'll be going in the right direction
realize that persistence can go a long way being stubborn is often an attribute
@nycdeb8tr mr trump i would love to see you spice things up and cut a rug on #dancingwiththestars they would love to have me
@luigiboria congratulations on getting the miss universe pageant to come to doral/miami it will be a great show and a tremendous success
the iraqi army has squandered the majority of the weapons and training we gave them for 10 long years when will we learn
so obama wants to bomb isis in iraq and arm them in syria what is he doing
are the republicans going to blow their chance to take the senate must focus on obamacare and amnesty
it was a great honor to be on @mikeandmike on @espn wow the response was amazing
on mike and mike @espn in two minutes
in order to stop the ebola outbreak in africa perhaps the president should put all africans on obamacare rather than sending the troops
every day mexico continues to hold sgt tahmooressi is an insult to our country
just met with david perdue @perduesenate he’s a fantastic guy who will fight hard against obamacare he will win
@sirsmooth61 taj employee here mr trump we will welcome you back with open arms we need you back thanks mark i am looking
we must immediately stop all air traffic coming from the ebola infected areas of africa before it is too late
entrepreneurs believe in yourself if you don't no one else will either
entrepreneurs achievers move forward at all times achievement is not a plateau it's a beginning
i've realized that success requires 100 percent effort and 100 percent focus nothing less
does anybody notice that atlantic city lost its magic after i left years ago i had the big boxing introduced ufc (ask dana)the best shows
can you believe that the us will be sending 3000 troops to africa to help with ebolathey will come home infected we have enough problems
it is so sad to see what has happened to atlantic city so many bad decisions by the pols over the years airport convention center etc
i left atlantic city years ago good timing now i may buy back in at much lower price to save plaza and taj they were run badly by funds
if you can’t focus with unyielding resolve then you will never be successful believe in yourself and you can accomplish your goals
congratulations to obama on building a strong economy there are 49500000 people on food stamps a historic record
obama’s promise to build an international coalition against isis is already broken no one trusts him at home or abroad
good luck to the people of scotland whatever their decision may be on thursday the whole world is watching really exciting
i will be on fox and friends at700 am enjoy
i have nothing to do with atlantic city sold years ago (great timing) for losers and haters i never went bankrupt plus $10 billion sorry
money was never a big motivation for me except as a way to keep score the real excitement is playing the game
secretary kerry cannot get other nations to join us in fighting isis they are afraid and he is a poor salesman who reps a pathetic leader
sen kay hagan voted for amnesty and obamacare she is a proven liberal who recklessly goes along with obama vote @thomtillis in november
the so called ‘moderate’ syrian rebels pledged their allegiance to isis after obama’s address we should not be arming them
the judge in the oscar pistorious case is a total moron she said he didn't act like a killer this is another oj disaster
they should have rebuilt the two buildings of the world trade center exactly as they were except taller and stronger a better statement
i can't believe that the judge in the oscar pistorious case has found him not guilty of murder no one has been more guilty since oj
can you believe that our very stupid politicians released the leader of isis and now we are spending billions trying to get him back
tell saudi arabia and others that we want (demand) free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private boeing 747spay up
middle eastern countries must participate militarily (no running away) and big league financially in order for us to go in and save them
i just want to know how much is saudi arabia and others who we are helping willing to pay for our saving from total extinction pay up now
if obama resigns from office now thereby doing a great service to the country i will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses
i made a great deal of money in atlantic city but left years ago when i saw so many political mistakes being made i have zero involvement
windmills are the greatest threat in the us to both bald and golden eagles media claims fictional ‘global warming’ is worse
why are we giving away our entire strategy and tactics we will deploy against isis it puts our troops at a disadvantage
fact – obama still has not fixed the backend of the obamacare website this could be the greatest internet boondoggle in history
new poll states that a record number of americans have lost all faith in president obama duh
everything you can imagine is real  pablo picasso
with the labor participation rate at a 36 yr low over 92m americans are out of the work force
@sassypantsjj please do more apprentices' know you're busy but once a year is not enough  love that show  thanks
if amnesty is so popular according to the dc ruling class then why is obama delaying his executive action until after the election
i will be on fox and friends @foxandfriends at 700 am (30 minutes) enjoy
getting ready to pay final respect to great lady joan rivers she could light up a room like no other she will be greatly missed

joan rivers had great talent but also truly amazing stamina and drive she would never give up or quit that is why she became a champion
i will be going to the funeral of my friend joan rivers today i got to know her really well when she became the winner of the apprentice
one of the big problems facing atlantic city are the ridiculously high real estate taxes which i fought for years before leavingcorruption

i just started construction of the old post office on pennsylvania avenue in dc many jobs will be finest hotel in us watch it happen
attention all hackers you are hacking everything else so please hack obama's college records (destroyed) and check "place of birth"
president obama has just reached an all time low approval rating is anybody surprised the happiest person is former president jimmy carter
i'm not saying to not give vaccines i am just saying give them small doses over a long period of time not one massive dose for a child
the obamacare website was hacked $5b dollars later and the site can’t even secure your personal information
china is going to complete 59 new theme parks by 2020 over $23b in expansion that would take over 100 years in our country
usmc sgt tahmooressi has now been held in mexican jail for over 150 days when will obama call for his release #freeourmarine

joan rivers @joan_rivers was an amazing woman and a great friend her energy and talent were boundless she will be greatly missed
senator landrieu if you are a senator representing louisiana then you should own a home in the state send @billcassidy to the senate
any american who fights w/ isis in iraq or syria should have their passport revoked if they try to come back in send them to gitmo
china continues to be on the move both technologically and militarily obama is sitting by and watching
as we are learning the hard way both domestically and internationally hope is not a strategy
i attended @aerosmith concert last night in newark nj doesn’t get any better than that @iamstevent was fantastic great energy
so many people who have children with autism have thanked me amazing response they know far better than fudged up reports
i'm not against vaccinations for your children i'm against them in 1 massive dosespread them out over a period of time and autism will drop
@iambedmatrix mr trump when is the announcement of miss universe host city we love you and your pageant we just want to know soon
i am being proven right about massive vaccinations the doctors lied save our children and their future

@lorenzolamas you are the man mr trump your als challenge was epic and all it represented love to the fam thanks lorenzo
saudi arabia should fight their own wars which they won't or pay us an absolute fortune to protect them and their great wealth $ trillion
have you been watching how saudi arabia has been taunting our very dumb political leaders to protect them from isis why aren't they paying
remember this the worst doctors (by far) are celebrity doctors if you see their names or read about them in the newspapers stay away
in my book @joan_rivers had a lousy doctor shoving a camera down her throat at her age something went really wrong that should not have
what is happening in atlantic city casino closures is very sad but does anybody give me credit for getting out before its demise timing
obama once said he “would be ignoring the law” by granting amnesty through executive action now he’s about to do it what will congress do
good luck and best wishes to my dear friend the wonderful and very talented joan rivers winner of celebrity apprentice amazing woman
i have asked the reigning miss universe and miss usa to do the honors at least i will not have to wash my hair this morning enjoy

emmy awards show was terrible last night same shows winning over and over again (politics) amazing race a joke host seth meyers bombed
@senscottbrown is the most competitive gop option against obama’s amnesty loving @senatorsheehan he can win
obama sent weapons through benghazi to isis yet he is holding up shipments to israel what is he thinking
obama’s motto if i don’t go on tax payer funded vacations and constantly fundraise then the terrorists win
once the isis thug who beheaded foley is identified 100 percent he should be bunker busted to hell
secretary of defense chuck hagel seems so lost and frankly dumb he can't even speak properly poor leader in these very dangerous times
the greater miami area and numerous others are fighting hard to get the miss universe pageant a decision will be made very soon

@suptsims it's scary to think we have obama for 2 more years we need a leader like you to change the course of this nation thank you
our politically correct country will read the isis terrorists who beheaded the reporter their miranda rights prior to good food and care
isis made a big mistake with the beheading of the reporter even people against intervention want them blown into oblivion leadership
re negotiation persistence can go a long way being stubborn can be good the key is to know when to loosen up
re negotiation patience is an enormous virtue and needs to be cultivated for successful negotiations on any level
re negotiation know exactly what you want and focus on that view conflict as an opportunity this will expand your mind and your horizons
believe you can and you're halfway there theodore roosevelt
the first general killed in a combat zone since vietnam it is a travesty that obama did not attend major general harold greene’s funeral
keep the big picture in mind there are always opportunities and thinking too small can negate a lot of them

the secret of getting ahead is getting started mark twain
sorry won't be doing fox and friends this morning will be in india on a couple of major business deals
we need a president who isn't a laughing stock to the entire world we need a truly great leader a genius at strategy and winning respect
the world as we know it is falling apart much of the blame can be attributed to the fact that the united states is no longer respected
@writeitnow a quote you'd like you have undertaken to cheat me i won't sue you for the law is too slow i'll ruin you vanderbilt
obama will send troops back into iraq combat zone don’t believe anything he says just covering for his mistakes
iraq is more dangerous today than any time under saddam war was a mistake as i said from the very beginning bush and obama should apologize
what other country tells the enemy when we are going to attack like obama is doing with isis whatever happened to the element of surprise
sorry i won’t be able to do @foxandfriends at 7 am on monday will be in india

the $200m in renovations of trump int’l washington dc are on track the old post office is being transformed into true luxury
it’s tuesday how many fundraisers travelling on the taxpayer dime will obama hold today
our government now imports illegal immigrants and deadly diseases our leaders are inept
so many people are agreeing with me on not creating a "highway" for ebola to the us started in small area of africa and now spreading fast
the bigger problem with ebola is all of the people coming into the us from west africa who may be infected with the disease stop flights
a doctor on nbc nightly news agreed with me we should not bring ebola into our country through two patients but should bring docs to them
achievers move forward at all times achievement is not a plateau it's a beginning
focus on your goals not your problems don't tread water get out there and go for it
briarcliff manor should get a better town manager philip zegarelli has no clue bad roads a total puppet of the mayor @westchestergov
mayor bill vescio of briarcliff manor westchester is doing a terrible job horrible roads high taxes housing down @westchestergov
we should have taken the oil in iraq and now our mortal enemies have got it and with no opposition really dumb us pols i'm so angry
isis terror group has now fully taken over large sections of iraq and will soon have control of massive oil reserves i told you so
@frankluntz works really hard but is a guy who just doesn't have it a total loser
the fact that we are taking the ebola patients while others from the area are fleeing to the united states is absolutely crazy stupid pols
the us must immediately stop all flights from ebola infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our "borders" act fast
if you read my last number of tweets only one opinion can be formed that our president and therefore "leader" is grossly incompetent
the obamacare website is in the news again it is turning out to cost even more than previously thought and it doesn't work big trouble
so many lives and two trillion dollars wasted and our worst enemies will get the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world such stupid leaders
just as i have been predicting for years iraq will fall to the people that hate the us the most just outside of baghdad"keep the oil"
the us cannot allow ebola infected people back people that go to far away places to help out are great but must suffer the consequences
@david_cameron why do you give scotland so much money to destroy their magnificent land with wind turbines causing massive taxes and e bills
@david_cameron as prime minister why are you spending vast amounts of money to subsidize ugly wind turbines in scotland that nobody wants
if you think you can do a thing or think you can't do a thing you're right henry ford
stop the ebola patients from entering the us treat them at the highest level over there the united states has enough problems
ebola patient will be brought to the us in a few days now i know for sure that our leaders are incompetent keep them out of here
if our border is not secure we can expect another attack a country with open borders is open to the terrorists

when in doubt obama fundraises he has held 393 fundraisers in six years another record
youth unemployment is at a record high obamacare is a job destroyer which is ruining aspiring careers it must be repealed
watch – obama will not fix the illegal immigrant loophole instead he will sign another executive action giving more amnesty
obama spoke to the mexican president last week and did not mention umc sgt tahmooressi sad
@token_one i just finished reading your book think like a champion" great stuff positive thoughts positive actions" thank you
@thebigjamesg staff at trump doral was amazing made my visit wonderful blue course is awesome doral as it should be great thanks
it's late in july and it is really cold outside in new york where the hell is global warming we need some fast it's now climate change
the republicans owe an apology for blowing the 2012 election how could they lose to obama
obama can sign an illegal executive action anytime for obamacare but he can’t fix the illegal loophole
this summer is very tough for the nation’s worst ag @agschneiderman moreland commission is his disaster
watched gennady golovkin @gggboxing at msg on saturday night he was fantastic should fight @floydmayweather

@margoshear the donald's going to be saying you're hired" to lots of people in the district @wusa9" true
less than 1 percent of obama’s $4b immigration request will go towards immediate border security a real scam enforce our laws now
obama is on yet another two day west coast fundraising swing has to fit it in before his 15 day tax payer funded vacation
@usgsa a momentous day great job on old post office we will make you proud
wow obama really put it to israel by canceling flights there this puts them at a tremendous disadvantage tourism and more will just stop
why is washington ready to spend billions on care for illegals while our va is still in shambles vets should be the priority
going to dc for big groundbreaking on old post office site will be spectacular new hotel lots of jobs

thanks @liljon for coming to my defense in rolling stone magazine as i have often said you are a terrific guy
i try to learn from the past but i plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present that's where the fun is
it takes "guts" to win
i believe that president obama is so overwhelmed by what is happening in the us and throughout the world that he has totally given up
obama wanted putin to reset instead putin laughed at him and reloaded
many people have said i’m the world’s greatest writer of 140 character sentences
it’s monday how many fundraisers will obama hold today
@jimmykimmel is terrific but for obama to fly on air force one ($’s) to do the show in these bad times is ridiculous
re negotiation realize that persistence can go a long way being stubborn is often an attribute

congrats to obama and democrats cbo has just announced that obamacare missed its uninsured target by half and program costs extra $700b+
if obama is concerned about the border he should stop vacationing gov't will save millions which it can use to stop illegal migration
obama claims that he needs an extra $4b to secure the border well then he should not have wasted $5b on the obamacare website
no matter what you're managing don't assume you can glide by you have to work to maintain your momentum trump how to get rich

mexico sent usmc andrew tahmooressi back to jail after court hearing mexico does not respect our border or us boycott #freeourmarine
iran looks like it is toying with john kerry on nuclear talks he is begging for a deal to save face negotiation is just not his thing
the @washingtonpost reported about the closing hotels in atlantic city but knowingly failed to report that i am not involved left years ago
can you imagine trading five really bad enemies of the us for the freedom of traitor bergdahl just another bad deal
deserter bergdahl returns to active duty as parents of brave soldiers killed looking for him grieve obama trying to play this mistake down
the only global warming that people should be concerned with is the global warming caused by nuclear weapons because of our weak us leader
the new hot term that they have recently invented is polar vortex give me a break
they only changed the term to climate change when the words global warming didn't work anymore come on people get smart
refloating the costa concordia for many hundreds of millions of $'s is ridiculous should have taken it apart in small pieces save fortune
it is a joke the amount of time that network news spends talking about the weather no wonder their ratings are way down enough already
record cold temperatures in july 20 to 30 degrees colder than normal what the hell happened to global warming
again for all of the haters and losers i have nothing to do with atlantic city got out a long time ago
i can't believe that 60 minutes is right now showing our nuclear facilities for the world to see (at request of us leadership) stupid
the harder you work the luckier you get
mexico cannot believe what they are getting away with and have absolutely no respect for our leader
mexican leadership has been laughing at us for many years but now it’s no longer laughter it’s disbelief
@justinrose99 great playing today in the scottish open i see our practice facility is helping use it a lot

@welles19 2016 = too late america won't survive another 12 months of this lawless o regime and @gop cowards that's what comebacks r about
usmc sgt tahmooressi sacrificed for our country while obama is welcoming illegals our marine is locked in a mexican jail #freeourmarine
our gov’t should immediately stop sending $’s to mexico no friend until they release marine and stop allowing immigrant inflow into us
@alexsalmond i hope you played well at royal aberdeen but u must admit the windmill hovering over hole 14 is disgusting and inappropriate
the most stringent gun laws in the us happen to be in chicago and look what is happening there
obama looks exhausted and beaten he was never made or prepared for the job like it or not he doesn't have "it"

obama is in texas but will not be visiting the border he is too busy fundraising
there is only one person who should be crossing our southern border usmc sgt tahmooressi boycott mexico #freeourmarine
we should cut off all aid to every country that does not respect our border why are we giving them money in the first place
if only the illegals were tea party members then obama would get them out of the country immediately
thank you to @golfweekmag for naming trump international golf links scotland #1 gbandi best modern course  a great honor
just looked at new selection of donald j trump signature collection ties and shirts @macys  fantastic would make great gifts
be a yardstick of quality some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected steve jobs
our country will soon be relegated to third world status if proper decisions are not made by our president he was never qualified for job
the immigration crisis is a horrible mess made worse by an incompetent president who doesn't have a clue we need new leadership fast
obama’s statement that illegals “can’t stay” = obama’s promise “if you like your healthcare plan you can keep it”

entrepreneurs stay focused and be tenacious remain fixed on your goals
entrepreneurs believe in yourself if you don't no one else will either
entrepreneurs see yourself as victorious look at the solution not the problem
i'm convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non successful ones is pure perseverance steve jobs
amazing people are sending letters of support for @trumpchicago’s sign to my other properties including even @trumpscotland thank you
what can you learn today that you didn't know before set the bar high do the best you possibly can
the more you know the more you realize how much you don't know how can you possibly discover anything if you already know everything
business is a creative endeavor cultivate a sense of discovery and start thinking big
i look forward to my press conference @trumpturnberry scotland this wednesday lots of great people attending

i am in ireland inspecting my great and very beautiful atlantic ocean property it is one of the most spectacular hotels anywhere doonbeg

lightweight @agschneiderman is driving business out of new york for his own public relations benefit a real dope
i know shia labeouf @thecampaignbook and when sober a really nice guy must get act together fast before too late
i just arrived in barcelona i make a big speech tomorrow and then off to ireland and scotland
practice positive thinking this will keep you focused while weeding out anything that is unnecessary negative or detrimental
realize that persistence can go a long way being stubborn is often an attribute
success requires 100 percent effort and 100 percent focus nothing less
control your own destiny or someone else will jack welch
our q1 gdp was 29 percent worst in memory  obamacare killing jobs stopping growth and making small business insecure
i'm leaving now for ireland spain scotland and elsewhere crazy life
after these spirited primaries are over @gop must be fully united for november if we take the senate we stop obama’s agenda
someone just wrote that “you predicted every single major event that’s now happening and they knock you instead of giving you credit”
as iran began the process of taking over iraq many people wanted me to say that “i told you so” – so i told you so
…in other words secy john kerry is so out of his element…
secy john kerry has a tough job but he looks so totally lost negotiating w/ those characters who are cleaning his clock sad to watch
eli wallach was a great actor and a great guy my opinion his performance in the good the bad and the ugly was his all time best
i look forward to my press conference on weds of next week @trumpturnberry to discuss changes and big investment i'll make very exciting
boycott mexico until they release our marine with all the money they get from the us this should be an easy one no respect

@astock1058 looking to open my own businesses any advice you can give on that subject find something you love doing and never give up
the 91112 attack on the benghazi consulate was a sophisticated multi prong wave attack when will all the 50+ fighters face justice
the benghazi terrorist is getting speedier care than our vets at the va obama has his priorities
a @senatormcdaniel win is a victory for our country chris is a constitutional conservative who'll make a difference in washington
i am the only potential owner of the @buffalobills who will keep the team in buffalo where it belongs
@blutograndex know how u can tell trump is successful almost half the accounts he follows are businesses w/ his name in them interesting
i hope voters in mississippi cast their ballot for @senatormcdaniel he is strong he is smart and he wants things to change in washington
great going @themichellewie –you showed the world that all of that amazing talent is for real we love you at trump jupiter @tngcj
@d the government spends millions to keep bad people to come in via air travel now they go through mexico wish donaldtrump was in charge

it’s monday how much will premiums rise today because of obamacare repeal
@proventures excited to hear what trump has in store for #turnberry if anything like @trumpdoral we are in for a treat it will be great
the failing @nydailynews which just raised its prices because it’s dying said i wear a “wig” when they know i don’t dishonest
the dying @nydailynews asked me to do an editorial on the central park 5 ripoff and then they pretend it was my idea loser newspaper
i wonder if when secy kerry goes to iraq and afghanistan he pushes hard for them to look at global warming and study the carbon footprint
do you believe that secy kerry just went to egypt to talk about "human rights problems" and this as everything is being blown up around him
@graeme_mcdowell great playing graeme you are a true champion
i will be on fox and friends at 7 am 10 minutes much to talk about enjoy
i'd bet the lawyers for the central park 5 are laughing at the stupidity of nyc when there was such a strong case against their "clients"
how much money are the lawyers for the central park five getting out of the 40 million dollars or are they paid by the city (or both)
ny city is paying forty million dollars to five men that many think are guilty as hell so many facts should have been trial politics
i loved the day paul goldberger got fired (or left) as nytimes architecture critic and has since faded into irrelevance kamin next
@ronkarkoviceff trump tower in chicago is a masterpiece that completes a gorgeous skyline thanks
i actually enjoyed the piece re sign @thedailyshow could it be that i’m starting to like jon stewart
@cycick donald trump is the king of quotes you really should listen to himthanks
@adamwebb_uk '@primeministersx incompetence should not be rewarded' you gotta love dt he does call a spade a spade #honesty
@primeministersx has no clue what’s going on in st maarten mullet bay is a third world slum
resolve never to quit never to give up no matter what the situation jack nicklaus
pm sarah westcot williams incompetence should not be rewarded you should vote for anyone who runs against her loser @primeministersx
mullet bay golf course looks like a slum on the beautiful island of st maarten @primeministersx should be ashamed for allowing this
every day st maarten loses vital tourism dollars due to the incompetence of pm sarah westcot williams @primeministersx
manufacturing is now less than 9 percent of us gdp the rust belt heart of our country’s factory sector has been destroyed by our leaders
what took so long to catch only 1 of the benghazi terrorists especially after the killer has been taunting the us in the press f/2 yrs
us army reserve @leezeldin will bring conservative solutions to dc next tuesday vote for lee in the ny 1 primary #zeldinforcongress
will the benghazi terrorist use the videotape as a defense if so will obama apologize to him
a country that cannot protect its borders is a country destined to fail another broken promise by our leaders in washington
every poll shows high approval of the new sign on @trumpchicago i am honored by the great support
may god have mercy upon my enemies because i won't general george s patton
america used to be the leader of the world thanks to obama america isn't even leading from behind
just met with the incoming speaker of the florida house @stevecrisafulli – a fantastic guy he will be a truly great leader
@nikkio just saw photos of sign at night looks really nice chronic complainers moan about everything ignore them thanks
@clarkr3000 love the sign in chicago you built it and have every right to stamp your trademark on it kudos thank you
i was right tv ratings for us open are way down from last year people don’t want to look at a burned out ugly course
with our border not being secure obama is giving a pathway to terrorists to enter our country an attack is on him
@carrgaz trump completes his takeover of turnberry and puts his own stamp on it full story in tomorrow's carrick gazette great
@top40mogul there is never enough trump on @sternshow why not have him on the phone at least once per month @howardstern thanks
@paigekblake of all the places i've stayed in oahu trump international is the best #greatservice #besthotel #awesomestaff #luxury thx
i will be doing the howard stern show at 7 am (10 minutes) always fun and interesting talking to howard
it's time to let pete rose the all time hits leader into the baseball hall of fame enough already
i bought the great turnberry resort today considered by many to have the greatest golf course in the world i will take good care of it
success comes with hard work focus and luck the luck comes to those who seek it out if you are not in the game you cannot get lucky
when isis caught the soldiers do you think they read them their legal rights prior to executing them
choose your own path it doesn't have to be the path less traveledwhat matters is that it's the right one for you vince lombardi
iraq is no longer our problem we never should have been there in the first place
the va scandal will only get worse over the time our vets deserve the best care possible we must be open to private solutions
congratulations to @spurs on their @nba championship well deserved
if anybody else but coore and crenshaw designed pinehurst they would be run out of town (and the turtleback greens are totally unfair)
the only reason i am critical of the pinehurst look is because i’m a lover of golf and that look on tv hurts golf badly
will be doing fox and friends at 7 2 minutes
@mattginellagc matt you know nothing about quality golf or what it takes to make golf successful you are all talk no substance
@mattginellagcsadly matt you don't understand golf (even though you think you do)i have numerous couses that are far superior to pinehurst
@mattginellagc i have watched open championships at turnberry one of the great golf courses of the world pinehurst not in the same league
@mattginellagc my position on pinehurst is correct bad for the game a dried out cow pasture you have no clue but keep trying
johnny miller correctly very critical of greens at pinehurst said they should be "redone"
i'd bet the horrible look of pinehurst translates into poor television ratings this is not what golf is about
@golfdigestmag big news from scotland on turnberry (which by the way blows pinehurst away) tomorrow morning stay tuned
@hollysandersgc remember it was martin k who sank the big ten footer to win the ryder cup he can handle the pressure
i would like to wish all fathers even the haters and losers a very happy fathers day
@blairkamin blair you may be the worst architectural critic in the business but thanks for your nice reviews about trump chicago and sign pr
@mattginellagc have you ever seen trump national/bedminster or trump international golf links in scotland both far better than pinehurst
@mattginellagc matt the statement about pinehurst looking like a local community golf course"awful" was not made by me but tweeted to me
@mattginellagc it's true matt the new "blue monster" is better than pinehurst so is bedminster turnberry and trump aberdeen blow it away
i have been very consistent and always said that iraq would fall as soon as the us left what a terrible waste of lives and money
iran will convince our incompetent president that they are trying to help us with iraq take over the country and oil and "o" will say thanks
turnberry in scotland is a far superior golf course to pinehurst and it isn't even close likewise the blue monster at doral
iran is moving troops into iraq under the guise that it is helping out actually they will take over iraq and all of their oil stupid us
if you want to be successful in business you must take risks make sure each risk is calculated and can have a positive fallback
w/ the ransom obama paid for deserter bergdhal getting mexico to release usmc sgt andrew tahmooressi is much harder #bringbackourmarine
jailed usmc sgt andrew tahmooressi should be released immediately since when does mexico care about border security#bringbackourmarine
had a great time yesterday on @theviewtv with @whoopigoldberg @jennymccarthy @sherrieshepherd and guest host @mrjerryoc
the iraqi army is useless president obama stay the hell out of iraq (we should never have been there in the first place)
we should never have gone into iraq but once in should have gotten out a lot faster make america great again
dopey @chicagotribune critic fails to mention the ugly sun times sign
before i bought the site the sun times had the biggest ugliest sign chicago has ever seen mine is magnificent and popular
in answer to your questions about my favorite impersonator the answer is darrell hammond
people are loving the trump sign on the chicago building big league tweets letters and calls…
a third rate architecture critic who i thought got fired for the failing @chicagotribune likes the building but doesn’t like the trump sign
i told all of the haters and losers long ago that iraq would fall take the oil or get out fast massive waste of lives and trillions of $'s
iraq told us to get out iraq is now falling and iraq now wants us to come back don't do it unless we get the oil and i mean all of it
iraq is falling apart fast two trillion dollars and so many deaths bush got us in and obama took far too long to get us out
btw the miss usa pageant was the highest rated non sports telecast on the big 4 networks congrats to our newly crowned @nia_sanchez_
we are what we repeatedly do excellence therefore is not an act but a habit  aristotle
the @gop primary voter spoke last night in va 7 and @davebratva7th won going away now the party must stand behind him unity unity unity
congratulations to @bretbaier on the immediate and tremendous success of his book ‘special heart’ already in its third printing
iraq is far worse and of more danger to the us now than it ever was under saddam hussein and this after $2 trillion and so many lives
as i have said the tea party is alive and well and fighting hard for the usa big win today
tea party takes down eric cantor really big win
what i am saying is that we never should have been in iraq in the first place bush was terrible obama is worse make america great again
i told you so a long time ago iraq just lost second largest city as their soldiers drop their guns and run only the beginning oil
five us soldiers killed in afghanistan by so called friendly fire what are we doing
@mdamelincourt thanks m you are doing a great job at trump toronto
negotiation tip know exactly what you want and focus on that trust your instincts even after you've honed your skills
negotiation is an art treat it like one be open to change it's another word for innovation
negotiation tip view any conflict as an opportunity this will expand your mind as well as your horizons persistence can go a long way
@mkathleenhunter donald that's a wonderful picture of you and your dad you can sense his love and pride in you thank you
heading over to the miss usa pageant the young women participating are amazing and accomplished competition is very tough enjoy the show
the man made "climate change" that our "great" president should be focused on is of the nuclear variety brought upon us because of weakness
the miss usa pageant will be amazing tonight to be politically incorrect the girls (women) are really beautiful nbc at 8 pm
no president in history has lied to the american people more than president obama in fact it is not even close
we have to make the usa rich again so that we can afford to pay social security medicareand medicaid and strong to keep our enemies out
by the end of this year china will be the number one economic power on earth and the us will owe 20 trillion dollars much of it to china
just toured baton rouge louisiana great people fantastic place doing really well miss usa pageant totally sold outtomorrow night nbc
i am in baton rouge where the miss usa pageant will be shown live on nbc on sunday night for 3 hours starting at 8 pm incredible show
the owner of california gold just made a jerk (fool) out of himself just smile and congrat the winner his wife was visibly embarrassed
@andrewkreig thank you andrew so correct
will be in louisiana for the miss usa pageant which will be on nbc on sunday night watch miss pennsylvaniaan interesting and amazing story
negotiation tip #1 the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it @realdonaldtrump"
obama is without question the worst ever president i predict he will now do something really bad and totally stupid to show manhood
breaking news obama has just made a trade with russia they get florida california and our gold supply we get borscht and a bottle of vodka
i believe that in addition to the 5 terrorist leaders president obama gave up for bergdahl a great deal of cash was also given so stupid
@bretbaier has a wonderful new book #specialheart and it’s proving to be a great success already bret is a winner
congratulations to @joniernst on her impressive @iowagop primary win last night now all should unite and defeat bruce braley this november
obama can release 5 senior taliban for a deserter but can’t make mexico release decorated marine sgt andrew tahmooressi pathetic
obama betrays israel yet again our strongest ally in the middle east he will recognize hamas breaking long standing us policy
@trumplasvegas' 7th floor provides the most urbane feel in las vegas w/private air conditioned cabanas and a massive 110 ft heated pool
@nklaeger we need a successful business person to upright the usano rookies trump is the man to do it thanks i agree
i hope we never find life on other planets because there's no doubt that the us government will start sending them money
if you like to work hard you will attract people with the same ethic think like a billionaire
chris mcdaniel looks like he will win in mississippi great news and big victory for tea party
obama never consulted with congress about a prisoner exchange he broke the law and should be tried our president is a total disaster
are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence
was susan rice told to lie about bergdahl obama and his representatives lie about virtually everything from obamacare to a deserter
@newsbusters thank you for a great and very accurate story well done
rapidly failing @vanityfair magazine hits me for my strong stance against obama's "brilliant" 5 killers for 1 deserter trade amazing
the five taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now they are saying how dumb us is
our president is a great embarrassment to the us how could anybody be so dumb or know so little as to make the very stupid 5 for 1 swap
it would be nice if our commander in chief was as concerned for our veterans health as he is for illegal immigrants becoming citizens
moving forward f/tonight’s competitive primaries it is crucial that the tea party and @gop remain united towards november take the senate
obama’s war on coal is killing american jobs making us more energy dependent on our enemies and creating a great business disadvantage
be sure to buy this month’s @amspec magazine read “a trump card” my interview with jeffrey lord
because of our terrible leaders it is now open season on every american throughout the world terrorists are thrilled
president said we would never leave a soldier behind how about the 4 who died in benghazi
great deal we swap 5 killer terrorists for a us military deserter that’s how the us negotiates nowadays
@taylor_mcbath obama is actively destroying the greatest country in the world we are going to pay a horrible price for his recent actions
bowe bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to solders died looking for him us should never have made the deal punishment
only a grossly incompetent government led by an equally incompetent president could have made the terrible trade for bergdahl #orangeroom
that the obama administration didn't know the facts about who bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic
entrepreneurs keep your momentum going it's a big factor in sustaining your success keep moving forward
entrepreneurs if you cannot handle the tough times you will never be successful in business stay positive and stay strong
@woodrowwinters nothing would make me prouder than to see mr trump in the oval office business would get done thanks and true
@talismanjohnnya been waiting 3 weeks for my fixd is the man and just states things 'the way they are' love his segments great thx
@arseniohall just got “fired” the people spoke ratings were terrible the apprentice brought him back from the dead but he blew it
the statement about leaving the base came directly from cbs evening news
at some point sgt bergdahl will have to explain his capture in 2009 he simply wandered off his base without a weapon many questions
the us cannot negotiate with terrorists it is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved but this can only lead to disaster
president obama created a very bad precedent by handing over five taliban prisoners in exchange for sgt bowe bergdahl another us loss
i am in toronto checking the great trump international hotel highest rated hotel in canada it is a beauty
#thearseniohallshow well it had to happen people that are disloyal in the long run never make it arsenio was just cancelled
snowden is a traitor and a disgrace make no mistake he is no hero in fact he is a coward who should come back and face justice
the american worker is being victimized by our trade policies we need smart trade which can only be accomplished by smart dealmakers
our country is on the precipice washington is broken where is the leadership
our vets are the pride of our nation the va scandal is a disgrace if you can get food stamps so fast our vets should get immediate care
snowden is a liarand a fraud
have you ever seen our country look weaker or more pathetic snowden obamacare va russia jobs decimated military debt and so much more
entrepreneurs be prepared and be tough cover your bases there are a lot of ups and downs but you can ride them out if you're prepared
focus on your goals not your problems and remember problems are a mind exercise so enjoy the challenge
intrinsic means basic inborn elemental if you have an intrinsic value it cannot be taken away think like a champion
thank you for all of the really nice comments and reviews concerning my speech today at the national press club it was my great honor
like it or not edward snowden is a spy and should be tried as a spy he has stolen invaluable information and damaged us with other nations
the boston bomber got immediate emergency surgery for a gunshot yet our vets die on waiting lines at the va we must do better
our greatest weakness lies in giving up the most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time thomas a edison
winners never quit and quitters never win vince lombardi
i am speaking today at the national press club totally sold out and will then be inspecting the old post office on pennsylvania avenue
@pasvote red in 2014 and 2016 and remove these inept clowns and party out for the next 8 years donald trump run for pres americans are fed up

@mcilroyrory way to go rory fantastic victory
have a great and peaceful memorial day but remember there are people out there who don't want us to have peace we must be strong
the obama administration gives better medical care to al qaeda at gitmo than to our vets
the va scandal shows the fatal ineptitude of big central planning government when will we learn
remember our brave men and women who have fallen protecting our country this memorial day
very excited to be addressing the @repleadconf next friday in new orleans there is much to discuss

going now to make a major speech before some of the world's biggest investors in dubai
remember china is not a friend of the united states
a classic china just signs massive oil and gas deal with russia giving russia plenty of ammo to continue laughing in us face
entrepreneurs see yourself as victorious and the best way to be victorious is to be passionate find something you love doing
entrepreneurs stay focused and be tenacious pay attention to people who know what they're talking about stay fixed on your goals
entrepreneurs get a momentum going listen apply then move forward do not procrastinate see opportunity as the perk that it is
the roads and sidewalks airports and bridges are perfect in dubai everything looks clean and strong in us everything is falling apart

dennis thank you for being honest somebody put words in your mouth and you wouldn’t take it great @dennisrodman

the global warming we should be worried about is the global warming caused by nuclear weapons in the hands of crazy or incompetent leaders
dennis rodman was either drunk or on drugs (delusional) when he said i wanted to go to north korea with him glad i fired him on apprentice
crazy dennis rodman is saying i wanted to go to north korea with him never discussed no interest last place on earth i want to go to
russia is on the move in the ukraine iran is nuking up and libya is run by al qaeda yet obama is busy issuing ‘climate change” warnings

@trumpgolfdc congrats to my great members at trump national dc on our club having been chosen to host the 2017 pga senior championship
the ring announcers are working hard to justify the mayweather victory they should be ashamed of themselves a total joke
no wonder boxing is close to dead
crowd is booing the hell out of that phony decision place is angry and going wild fight was not even close disgusting
the mayweather decision is a disgrace
no way judges say mayweather won investigation should take place fix
fight is over mayweather lost big but lets see what judges say
mayweather is getting absolutely killed
floyd mayweather is being beaten up badly through 10 rounds by marcos maidana but announcers say it is even two rounds left
the reporter that called kevin durant "mr unreliable" should be fired or at least apologize he is a truly great player and a winner
there must be a higher standard of accuracy in the media incredible that some so called "journalists" can make up lies and get away with it
@noe donald trump #raffaelesollecito was unfairly convicted he didn’t kill anyone the italian government should be ashamed” #innocent"
have a great weekend everyone and for those of you that are young entrepreneurs have fun but never stop thinking of the task ahead victory

never make a concession during negotiations that could lead to more demands be prudent it's best to have your concessions predetermined
negotiations 101 the best deals you can make are the ones you walk away fromand then get them with better terms
with @vanityfair circulation and advertising revenue doing so badly rumor has it that dopey graydon carter is going to resign he should

it will now start to cool down concerning sterling and the clippers this mess will start to fade after litigation into the murky past
commissioner adam silver made a strong and very wise decision concerning donald sterling
@paul1994loan they should quote you word for word if they are going to use what you said selective editing is very unfair true
@foxesba i knew the mainstream media was going to selectively hear what you were saying as i listened to your interview so did i
dopey @ariannahuff should force her reporters to be accurate if she has that power
it’s important to listen to what people say “horrible” and “disgusting” are the words i used in response to sterling’s comments
it is also amazing how comments can be edited to provide statements that are used in a knowingly incorrect manner
@balango212 donald j trump my biggest inspirational in life thank you
a truly great champion will seldom fail and always come back never underestimate the power of greatness
it is amazing that after lambasting donald sterling on @foxandfriends some dishonest press only reported my girlfriend from hell statement
young entrepeneurs think big stay motivated and always remain confident the sky is the limit
putin has shown the world what happens when america has weak leaders peace through strength
i will be doing fox and friends at 700 will be discussing the the donald sterling (clippers) mess
president obama is losing on so many fronts in fact all fronts that i am concerned he will do something totally irrational he can't lead
isn't it ironic that china is going all in nuclear for energy while at the same time making wind turbines for others @alexsalmond
if you have passion confidence resilience and vision you could become an entrepreneur add focus to the list and you're off to a good start
@61yellowjacket love @theapprentice inspirational awesome businessman teacher and great role model for all generations thank you

to be a visionary you have to chase impossibilities few ever get rich easily think like a billionaire
interesting how president obama is flying around in a boeing 747 on so called earth day
the way president obama runs down the stairs of air force 1 hopping and bobbing all the way is so inelegant and unpresidential do not fall
always remember sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make
last thursday obama said "investing in infrastructure would improve our economy for the long term" the next day he again stopped keystone

once the tragic mistake of going into iraq was made we should have at least taken the oil (or at least some of it) now iran and china get it
after thousands lost and spending two trillion dollars iraq (i told you so) is imploding really dumb pols put us and kept us there so sad
if america unlocked its energy potential we would once again be the most powerful country in the world washington is holding us back
obama told medvedev after the ’12 reelect he would “have more flexibility” it was music to putin’s ears
the biggest winner of obama’s ’08 win  vladimir putin ultimately he could be tied with iran after tehran becomes a nuclear power
a storied franchise with a loyal fanbase @buffalobills should remain in buffalo
we all know that chess is a game of strategy so is business think like a champion

@suew777 words i never expected to say in this lifetimei hope mrtrump buys the bills i think its the best for teamandfans @nflcommish
@frankpro frank you are making a mistake no one will do a better job than me and team would stay in buffalo
have to go now to sign a great and job producing deal good night
snowden is a spy who has caused great damage to the us a spy in the old days when our country was respected and strong would be executed
i give secretary of state john kerry credit for working and trying hard but he has zero negotiating ability
remember russia still has snowden when are we going to bring that piece of human garbage back home to stand trial he caused great damage
i will be working late into the evening closing a big real estate deal soon to be announced happy easter and/or holiday to all
@jywjr as much as buffalo respected and loved mr wilson it would bring excitement and prestige to have mr trump own the bills @nflcommish
@mjohnstonxoxo my favorite part of school is watching the first season of the apprentice in business tech great
i was always a big fan of kim novak and still am a wonderful actress
why did pres obama remove sanctions against iran prior to negotiating rather than completing successful negotiation and then remove sanctions
the harder you work the harder it is to surrender @profootballhof @buffalobills head coach marv levy
remember if you don’t sell yourself no one else will make sure the public friends and the business community hears about your success
cbo now estimates that over 25m will lose jobs directly because of obamacare repeal now before it is too late
@eric_alon you buying @buffalobills would be the biggest thing since they were in 4 straight super bowls great for them and @nfl@nflcommish

@michael_haz donald why don’t you go out to nevada and cut a deal for #clivebundy no one is a better deal maker than you go do it true
entrepreneurs have your own vision and stick with it don’t be afraid to be unique don’t tread water get out there and go for it
entrepreneurs identify your goals know precisely what you want to achieve then study the best people in your field and learn from them
entrepreneurs always remember that every day counts stay focused stay positive and develop momentum
success breeds success the best way to impress people is through results think like a billionaire
get snowden back from russia he has done tremendous damage to the us and should pay a very heavy price
on top of the disrespect shown by russia don’t forget they still have snowden who has given them (and everyone) massive us secrets
remember negotiations are fluid remain calm and don’t settle easily if you have the goods you will ultimately win
i'm convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non successful ones is pure perseverance steve jobs
@alexsalmond i have no doubt that you will come to your senses about the costly bird killing and very ugly wind turbines dotting scotland
@alexsalmond ireland just ended the bird killing wind farm near my great resort on the atlantic ocean the reason would hurt tourism
al sharpton said they are "even making it more harder to register people to vote" which is worse his grammar or his thoughts
obama lied when he said “you can keep your plan” so why would anyone believe his bogus obamacare enrollment numbers

to all haters and losers i am not anti vaccine but i am against shooting massive doses into tiny children spread shots out over time

entrepreneurs believe in yourself if you don’t no one else will either realize that becoming an entrepreneur is not a group effort
entrepreneurs another question to ask yourself “what am i pretending not to see” there may be great opportunities right around you

with autism being way up what do we have to lose by having doctors give small dose vaccines vs big pump doses into those tiny bodies
@realjuliemallen indeed she was mrt she also looks like she was beautiful person as well great moms matter they shape who wer thank you
healthy young child goes to doctor gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines doesn't feel good and changes autism many such cases
coach w to his basketball players be quick but don't hurry
if i were president i would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take autism
autism way up i believe in vaccinations but not massive all at once shots too much for small child to handle govt should stop now

if you’ve looked over the yearsi’ve been right on virtually every issue from iraq (not going in but if so taking the oil) to jobs to china
by obama mentioning manhattan yesterday in his response he has singlehandedly made it target #1 how totally stupid is this guy
this is the time for the united states to be strengthening all important military components not rolling over and dealing from weakness
not good or smart for obama to be calling russia a "regional" power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in nyc
president obama looks absolutely exhausted in the netherlands he is not a natural leader was never ment to lead it is tough work for him
he that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else benjamin franklin

@jvickersdc staying at trump international resort in miami well done sir wish we could stay a couple more days great family vaca thx
obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off air force one doesn’t look presidential and at some point he will take a fall
i wonder if apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iphone i hear they will be doing it soon long overdue
obama must now focus get his mind off "marchmadness" and lead watch russia closely work hard on the economy and get rid of obamacare
the situation with russia is much more dangerous than most people may think and could lead to world war iii we need great leadership fast
we should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever must be very strong to prosper and survive
i believe putin will continue to re build the russian empire he has zero respect for obama or the us
putin has become a big hero in russia with an all time high popularity obama on the other hand has fallen to his lowest ever numbers sad
great advice from my mother “trust in god and be true to yourself” – mary macleod trump
great advice from my father "know everything you can about what you're doing" fred c trump
continuous effort not strength or intelligence is the key to unlocking our potential  winston churchill
president obama be cool be smart be sharp and focus (no more march madness) and you can beat putin at his own game it can be done
while putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the world president obama is watching march madness (basketball)
i don't hate obama at all i just think he is an absolutely terrible president maybe the worst in our history
we're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly chinese passengers and that's ok but how much are russia and china spending

realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort you're in charge everything starts with you
entrepreneurs be ready for problems you'll have them every day keep open to new ideas that's where innovation begins
@tseay18 find work that you love you have to be passionate about it to succeed then focus and never give up
@zootmantom     @realdonaldtrump love your words of wisdom merry christmas and happy new year thanks
@bigboblarsen    i don't always agree with you but i must say you do know how to inspire thank you
#3 look at the solution not the problem learn to focus on what will give results
#2 keep your momentum without momentum a lot of great ideas go nowhere
#1 keep the big picture in mind there are always opportunities and possibilities and thinking too small can negate a lot of them

it’s friday how many people have been forced off their plans and lost their doctors today because of obamacare
white house relaxes penalty for canceled health policies a major blow to the sustainability (and concept) of obamacare they are desperate

go to macy's today and buy trump ties shirts suits and cufflinks as a christmas or holiday presentgreat style great price only the best
the coolest story is that john beale the man who headed up climate change for the government is a proven con man and total phoneyarrested
the more time you spend feeling sorry for yourself the more time you waste after a setback move on and quickly embrace the next challenge
i just left the trump tower atrium it is packed with great people #1 tourist attraction in nyc fun #trumptower

@ali_nugent good luck on your real estate test you will be the biggest star of all
wow just in john beale the top person in government on climate change (epa) is a total fraud and just admitted it what can they say now
we should be focusing on beautiful clean air and not on wasteful and very expensive global warming bullshit china and others are hurting our air
they call it "climate change" now because the words "global warming" didn't work anymore same people fighting hard to keep it all going
59 percent of the united states by area is now covered in snow highest percent in many years the "global warming" name isn't working anymore sorry
wow it's snowing in isreal and on the pyramids in egypt are we still wasting billions on the global warming con make us competitive
president obama and other world leaders don't know how close they were to being seriously injured (or worse) standing next to psycho in sa
@lisa_smith70      a real president wouldn't take a selfie during any memorial service #nelsonmandelamemorial
how amazing the state health director who verified copies of obama’s “birth certificate” died in plane crash today all others lived
i hope you all are looking at the donald j trump signature collection of ties shirts and cufflinks @macys great for christmas and holidays

@borland_jim     after staying at the trump international hotel and tower in nyc everything else seems subpar thank you
re kerry admitting to “working” for pastor abedini’s release why has us already released iranian spies and nuclear scientist dumb
@johnkerry claims he has "never stopped working” f/pastor abedini’s release through “back channels" where are the results
@ymatthews956      have u ever considered meeting w/ obama he might be open to your wisdom and business savvy i doubt it
after climbing a great hill one only finds that there are many more hills to climb nelson mandela
@markhalperin’s and john heilemann’s book double down is an excellent read on the just passed election great book congrats @jheil
come on mlb do the right thing let @peterose_14 into the hall no drugs just hard work and talent
iran must immediately allow christian #pastorsaeed out of prison or we should put back sanctions (which should never have been lifted)
naghmeh abedini the lovely wife of the christian pastor saeed being held in an iranian jail just left my office #savesaeed
state senator shirley huntley "ratted" on black politicians and was believed when she ratted on @agschneiderman nobody listened racism
major league baseball the best thing you can do is let @peterose_14 your all time hits leader into the hall of fame it's time
@adamricheal      donaldtrump for pres 2016 america's economy needs his business midas touch and no nonsense approach thx
if graydon carter's very dumb bosses would fire him for his terrible circulation numbers at failing vanity fair his bad food restaurants die
the ill conceived windfarm that @alexsalmond is pushing for aberdeen will lose $50 million a year only a fool would build it or want it
bird killing windfarm that i oppose in aberdeen just got delayed by at least two years@alexsalmond forced the failing developers to delay
wh claims it lied about pres obama living with his uncle b/c “wasn’t mentioned in his book” i guess bill ayers never knew about it
graydon carter whose reign over failing @vanityfair has been a disaster has acted in two movies both bombed and got bad reviews
it’s time for @peterose_14 to enter @mlb’s @baseballhall all time hits leader has paid the price
congrats to @joetorre @tonylarussa and bobby cox on all being unanimously elected to @mlb’s @baseballhall great leaders and managers

ps there is also something really good to say about humility being confident and humble is a great combination maybe the best of all
people are always asking me about the very special word confidence the fact is there is (almost) nothing like it is derived from winning
show me someone without an ego and i'll show you a loser having a healthy ego or high opinion of yourself is a real positive in life
@loispope1 word is that the dinner tonight at mar a lago hosted by the incomparable lois pope was fabulous big money raised for charity
in making big money knowledge is far more important than any other ingredient including money itself
my father fred trump left me a relatively small amount of money (compared to where i am today over $10 billion) but vast amount of knowledge
great going to all of dubai in winning what will be a fantastic #expo2020 we will all be there
ice storm rolls from texas to tennessee i'm in los angeles and it's freezing global warming is a total and very expensive hoax

you have to learn the rules of the game and then you have to play better than anyone else albert einstein
why is it that when warren buffett uses the bankruptcy laws to his benefit nobody cares but with me they go nuts
@vattenfallgroup couldn’t sell its money losing aberdeen windfarm so @alexsalmond forced phony extension @aberdeencc @aberdeenshire
the problem w/ the concept of "global warming" is that the us is spending a fortune on "fixing it" while china and others do nothing
wow record setting cold temperatures throughout large parts of the country must be global warming i mean climate change
congrats to @msnbc for firing martin bashir don’t feel badly he didn’t get ratings anyway @sarahpalinusa

@puddlejumper365 you have to have passion for your work that's most important then keep your focus intact good luck
you can only smile when the losers of the world try so hard to put down successful people just remember they all want to be you
with few exceptions only really smart people are able to make a lot of money hard work is also important but "brains" will supersede
i just filed a major ethics complaint against crooked new york state attorney general eric schneiderman he should resign from office
too bad about new york magazine but there's a much bigger one out there currently doing a story on me to get even that i'll soon discuss
remember i predicted that new york magazine would fold and people scoffed just announced (nypost) it lost big $'s and is cutting way back
congratulations to the white house for every 1 obamacare enrollment there are 44 cancellation notices very unfair
dying @gqmagazine just named me to a list too bad gq is no longer relevant won’t be around long

the least number of hurricanes in the us in decades so they change global warming (too cold) to climate change now what will they call it
that was a great football game
@10ajmccarron aj is a great quarterback who is finally being recognized as such a total winner what a pass
wow the obamacare website which president obama said would be working today is a total mess with many functions not even thought about
just left $259 million rebuilding of doral in miami amazing trump national doral will be a masterpiece (if i do say so myself)
today is the day that obamacare website was supposed to be up and working wrong website is closed down a total disaster 90 million doomed
trump international in dubai will be one of the great projects anywhere in the world congratulations to @damacofficial for their genius

@rspbscotland rspb is a total joke they went for bird chopping wind turbines in @aberdeenshire and fought me on bird friendly golf course
@rspbscotland must fight to save the massive bird population which will be devastated by wind turbines in @aberdeenshire @alexsalmond
despite the fact that i have had great success with the words you're fired i do not like firing people but zero on obamacare mess no way
why doesn't president obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie announce that obamacare was a mistake and deal a really great plan
us froze $8b in iranian assets during ’79 hostage crisis now obama is giving it back to iran while christian pastor is jailed don't do it
happy thanksgiving to all even the haters and losers
tell iran to let our christian pastor go and i mean right now if they don't there will be hell to pay
make sure to enjoy your time with your family during the holiday it is a special time love and appreciate your family
the $1b failed website is the tip of the iceberg on the obamacare over 90 million estimated will lose their plans next year
mr president tell iran to immediately free the christian pastor as a sign of good faith and if they refuse break off talks big sanctions
president obama said over and over again if you like your plan you can keep your plan period this turned out to be a total lie 90 mill
look at the solution not the problem learn to focus on what will give results
set the example you can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering that you are setting the example
how does obama rationalize giving iran $8b in sanction relief when a christian pastor is being tortured in an iranian prison
when do we sue the company for billions that robbed us in creating the hapless obamacare website
i can't believe no one has been fired over the obamacare website fiasco
vision remains vision until you focus do the work and bring it down to earth where it will do some good
i will be in palm beach jupiter and miami today checking on big construction projects i love florida and love on time and on budget const
president obama is finally getting hammered even by his most loyal supporters and the press i guess they can only take so much
new poll wow 53 percent say president obama is not honest and trustworthy what took them so long go back and look at his house purchase in chicago
don't worry the united states will be great again
just got home watching the news and every story is bad about the us someday we will return to being great again but we need leadership
obama is going to take away over 90m americans’ healthcare plans but he is letting iran keep its nukes just think about that
who would you rather have negotiating with iran president obama or toronto mayor ford my money is on ford
realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort you're in charge everything starts with you
don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities keep your focus intact and focus on the positives
after settling for a ridiculous 13 billion dollars jpmorgan's lawyer is critical of the amount of the fine why did they settle then dumb
best book ever on dealmaking (or so they say) trump the art of the deal go get it and others washington you really can do better
i know it has been many years since our country made great deals but isn't it about time we start right now make america great again
the reason great dealmakers do not openly celebrate a deal especially one that is not complete is that it shows weakness to the other side
john kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with iran great dealmakers do not celebrate dealsthey just go on to the next one
tom brady is a good friend of mine a great player a great guy and a total winner fantastic comeback win this is what our country needs
tom brady has done a great job tonight amazing new england comeback good game not over yet
we had all the leverage in our nuclear negotiations with iran and our leaders foolishly decided to let them out of the trap why
how much longer are we expected to put up with the world's most incompetent  leader obamacare iran syria bads deals just never ends
i will be on fox and friends tomorrow morning at 7 will be discussing basic stupidity and incompetence of which our "leaders" have plenty
snow and ice freezing weather in texas arizona and oklahoma what the hell is going on with global warming
get smart on knockout assaults and crime we have to be slightly more vicious (and violent) than the assaulter and crime would end fast
the scum that gets high on badly hurting old ladies and others through knockout assaults wouldn't feel that way with a gun at their head
we are using the absolute wrong negotiating technique with respect to the iran nuclear talks strengthen sanctions until great deal is made
young entrepreneurs – keep positive don’t let the obamacare disaster stop your endeavors there are great opportunities out there
it’s friday how many millions has the white house wasted on the obamacare website today
republicans have the right approach to obamacare – let it fail free market solutions will be embraced by americans in 2016
thomas jefferson wrote the senate filibuster rule harry reid and obama killed it yesterday rule was in effect for over 200 years
since the democrats decided to kill the filibuster they now own itrepublicans should keep the new rule when they're in the majority
if jp morgan took their case through the courts for 15 years nobody would be suing them easy target
for all those sick degenerates contemplating a knockout attack please remember the late great charles bronson no more crime
weak newscasters are asking "is there a racial component to knockout attacks" of course there is and weakness will only make it worse
if you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged and you carry a gun shoot the bastard (teach them a lesson)
knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth we better start getting tough in this country and they want to take our guns
host of the 2017 us women's open trump bedminster has been rated one of america's best golf courses
we have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in afghanistan their government has zero appreciation let's get out
figure out what really moves you you've got to have the 'fire' in order to have the midas touch midas touch
florida power and light did a fantastic job of providing service and energy during the big storm in palm beach @insidefpl
today will be a great day at work have only one word in mind victory
@morningmika i'm watching joe (who is 100 percent correct on afghanistan) fondling the once great time magazine so sad to see how skimpy it is
do not allow our very stupid leaders to sign a deal that keeps us in afghanistan through 2024 with all costs by usa make america great
results are what matter the bottom line is clearly the bottom line think like a champion
if you want to kill any idea in the world get a committee working on it charles kettering
$1b down another $1b to go obamacare website is 40 percent unfinished this is beyond pathetic
congratulations to @miketyson on the success of his new book "undisputed truth" and @hbo special and thanks for the nice words mike
afghanistan leaders want the us to keep 20 000 troops there for many more years fully paid for by the us but first they want apology
if everything seems under control you're not going fast enough mario andretti"
work is fun deals are fun life is fun but love of a great family makes it all come together go out there and make your family proud
always borrow money from a pessimist because he will never expect it to be paid back
the next obamacare disaster will be doctors being dropped from plans
broken promises a broken billion dollar website obamacare can’t be fixed repeal
if everything seems under control you're not going fast enough mario andretti
jamie dimon just gave away $13b to government in settlement terrible move and bad precedent could have done much better by fighting
last october on @meetthepress @chucktodd attacked @jack_welch and i for saying obama cooked the job number will he apologize
congratulations to @mariabartiromo on her big move to @foxbusiness she is a total winner
our heartfelt prayers go out to our fellow americans suffering from the storms and tornadoes
president obama played golf yesterday
the polls have shown that dead people voted for president obama overwhelmingly and without hesitation he must be doing something right
i will be going to trump national doral in miami early today to check on the construction of the hotel and the new blue monster amazing
how did the ncaa which is weak and becoming irrelevant extract such a big and reputation shattering settlement from penn state others zero
maybe some of the dead voters who helped get president obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for obamacare
the wimps that run penn state should be forced to resign (and be sued) for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy
@eveningexpress thank you for your fair and balanced reporting you provide a great and important service to the people of scotland
@reaiosmelsousa great job in helping our wonderful miss universe there is nobody like you congratulations
again more dead people voted in the last election than enrolled in obamacare congratulations america

i'll be on @gretawire on the record tonight to talk about the obamacare fiasco 7 pm on fox news
more dead people voted in the last election than enrolled in obamacare congratulations america
breaking news negotiations with iranians broke down because obama insisted that they use obamacare
president obama is the best thing that ever happened to jimmy carter
in a new poll a majority of people felt the president "knowingly lied" about health care pledge who are the fools who don't think he lied
@bretbaier you are doing really great keep it up (of which i have no doubt)
the same people that built the obamacare website used as the face of the website someone who is not a us citizen incompetent
can you believe it the model who mysteriously disappeared from the obamacare website is not a us citizen she’s from colombia
no matter how far down a path you go if it's the wrong path turn around and go back home before it is too late
obamacare is on life support it will soon be dead on arrival a bad concept that was imcompetently administered
president obama is under pressure from democrats to undo his lie on obamacare his problem is that such a move would end obamacare
obamacare is one of the worst political disasters of all time 4992343 americans losing coverage less than 50ooo new signups
everyone should watch the documentary ‘windfall’ on @netflix see an upstate ny town ruined by environmentalists and windfarms
miss usa pageant had a 4 to 1 vote in favor but it won't be in miami doral in 2014 mayor boria voted against it i want total support

we will only be the land of the free as long as we are home of the brave
don't worry when our country starts hurting bad enough from all of the mistakes that are being made we will start doing the right things
while i was in moscow i see that president obsma apologized for his lie i mean statement on obamacare how nice of him to be so forthright
the republicans must be patient and smart obamacare could sweep them into office in far greater numbers than anyone ever thought possible
if justice roberts had done the right thing and voted against obamacare our country would be in a lot better shape right now total turmoil
drew brees is having a great game a fantastic quarterback and really good guy
if we could force russia china and other competitors to use obamacare we would be able to instantly destroy their great economic success
remember that i predicted a long time ago that president obama will attack iran because of his inability to negotiate properly not skilled
i will be on fox and friends tomorrow morning at 7ºº
i just got back from russia learned lots and lots moscow is a very interesting and amazing place us must be very smart and very strategic
i was just given a great tour of moscow fantastic hard working people city is really energized the world will be watching tonight
i'm in moscow for miss universe tonight picking a winner is very hard they are all winners total sellout of arena big night in russia
leadership whatever happens you're responsible if it doesn't happen you're responsible

i will be going to asheville north carolina tonight for the 95th birthday party of the great billy graham such a wonderful man
if democrats do not start opposing obamacare and fast republicans will have a massive victory in 2014 far greater than any predictions
a level will be reached where obamacare will be so out of control expensive and unwieldy that the biggest supporters will abandon ship
prediction the disaster known as obamacare will only get worse and republicans will gain far greater power than they have had in years
put kathleen sebelius out of her misery and lovingly say you're fired let her go home to her family and rest bring in top flight people
she is so sad and pathetic that i almost feel sorry for secsebelius she has done great harm to many people and must be fired incompetent
just sit back and watch obamacare is such a disaster it will fall like a house of broken cards the website is the best part of this mess
when obama tried to tweak his previous statement on obamacare he made it an even greater lie even the senate democrats are angry with him
use your intelligence and your education to execute what your imagination presents to you this is one step to becoming an entrepreneur
job tip if you were the employer what kind of person would you most desire as an employee be that person
success tip see yourself as victorious this will focus you in the right direction apply your skills and talent and be tenacious
thilan_golfswag    @realdonaldtrump played doral for the first time absolutely great course fantastic job thanks
our nobel prize for peace president said "i'm really good at killing people" according to just out book double down can oslo retract prize
the truth is that we could have much better healthcare in our country at a much more affordable price everyone in us would benefit
can you believe that the builder of the failed obamacare website was just given a new government contract how stupid is that clueless
revisionist history now obama claims he never told us that everyone could keep their healthcare plans crazy
i would gain a whole new respect for president obama if he would say "look we made a big mistake sorry" no more lies or deception
@gop house has the right bill “if you like your healthcare plan you can keep it” the senate must take it up on a vote
the obamacare website will cost over $15b when all is said and done crazy
everyone is telling me that @eliotspitzer is going to run against lightweight @agschneiderman spitzer would win
will be on fox and friends in five minutes enjoy and good morning
millions losing healthcare plans despite president obama's promise that this would not happen what about a massive protest march on dc
the bus driver who saved the woman from jumping off the bridge was really cool great guy i'm going to send him $10 000 he deserves it

congratulations to boston on the @redsox world series victory earned and deserved
gary sinise is doing tremendous work for veterans through his foundation check it out @garysinisefound
the obamacare website is unfixable and rumor has it that they will stop checks and balances a free for all that will cost the country trillions
isn't the world tired of hearing president obama say he knew nothing about anything time to take responsibility for all of your mistakes
looks like a very good world series game
how come snowden and obamacare have access to all records and information but don't have even the smallest tidbits on president obama
obamacare is a disaster and snowden is a spy who should be executed but if it and he could reveal obama's recordsi might become a major fan
china just called they want to lend obama another $1b for the obamacare web site
if obama was willing to lie about obamacare then what else has he lied to us about…
four brave americans died in benghazi administration is still covering up the truth we deserve to know the full truth
congrats to @rushlimbaugh on the release of his new book “rush revere and the brave pilgrims” #1 on @amazon and @bnbooks must read
it is now a fact that president obama lied in order to get obamacare passed that is fraud and the legislation should be recinded interesting
i hear @billmaher really bombed in springfield people were leaving show way early stupid guy
won’t be a buyer’s market for long if you can purchase a home but remember i told you this three years ago
fact – all the countries complaining about us spying on them spy on us they just don't get caught stupid
@alexsalmond of scotland may be the dumbest leader of the free world i can’t imagine that anyone wants him in office
@alexsalmond –the man who let terrorist (pan am flight 103) al megrahi go lost another battle over ugly wind turbines in blackdog
@alexsalmond suffered a huge defeat by the people of blackdog communities all over scotland are fighting this loser
when will @alexsalmond realize that he's destroying scotland the most beautiful countryside in the world w/ his stupid wind turbines
great victory for people of blackdog scotland they defeated substation stopping inefficient and ugly wind turbines@alexsalmond
maybe if obama knew too much about the spying it would be worse than knowing nothing but either way it is just another disaster
i just don't know why some of these nfl teams with lousy quarterbacks don't give tim tebow a chance what do they have to lose
there are so many blatant lies coming out of the administration healthcare spying nsa irs brutally killed americans will it ever end
does anybody really think that president obama didn't know about our spying on the leaders of allies around the world not possible
like your current health care plan too bad you’re going to lose it under obamacare hope change and a 300 percent increase in your premium
contractors can blame obama admin all day for their $600m failure but both parties are at fault pay taxpayers back
i don’t know why our allies are so surprised obama is tapping their phones nothing changes

@10ajmccarron great game against tennessee by the most unappreciated (by the media) quarterback in college football and no more tattoos
good night everyone sleep well and tomorrow have many victories
i must say that some of these college football games are great tonight very exciting i wish i had more time to watch
i try to learn from the past but i plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present that's where the fun is ~donald trump"
isn't it amazing that the us and nsa can listen to the highly protected phone conversations of world leaders but can't get o's records
at this point the legacy of the obama administration will be sadly that of the gang that couldn't shoot straight what a pathetic mess
with the $635 million dollar website fiasco getting caught tapping phones of world leaders and so much more us is looking really stupid
can you imagine the anger and disgust when the heads of other countries found out that their cell phones were being tapped by nsaobama mess
first titantic sunk on its maiden voyagenext the hindenburg explodes on its first flight to americanow we suffer the obamacare rollout

good advice from my father fred c trump"know everything you can about what you're doing"
you've got something unique to offer find out what it is ask yourself what can i provide that does not yet exist
courage is being scared to death and saddling up anyway john wayne
it was just determined that the woman who passed out at obama’s press conference had just seen what her new premiums would be
if the saudis are so concerned about syria then they should go in themselves stop telling us to do their dirty work
i’ll soon be leaving for washington where @amspec will give me the t boone pickens entrepreneur award very exciting
where’s the accountability for the $635m website fiasco in the obama administration heads should roll and officials should be fired
why doesn't president obama call upon the nsa to fix the badly broken website then they could spy on all of the many cheaters and arrest them
honestly whether you're for or against obamacare the 635 million dollar website fiasco is bad for the us it makes us look totally inept
breaking news the washington redskins have just announced that they will be removing the name washington from their name
if you want to succeed keep your edge staying on top of all new developments in your sector = major advantage that pays dividends
have time to waste go to the obamacare website
looking forward to receiving the t boone pickens entrepreneur award at tomorrow’s @amspec robert l bartley gala dinner
i would bet that we have many great american technology companies that would build and fix the pathetic obamacare website for zero dollars
why doesn't president obama just get the people from google to fix the failed website in fact why didn't he use them in the first place
@nymag i hope everybody possible cancels their subscription to the failing boring abd totally biased new york "ragazine" save your money
the rollout of obamacare is a total disaster and an embarrassment to our country the world is watching and laughing$635000000 website
@nymag in every interview new york magazine has done for years they ask the same question "what do you think of donald trump" beggars
@nymag can you imagine a top editor at new york magazine calling for my death if they were responsible he would be fired totally biased
@nymag wow numbers are really looking bad at new york magazine while very boring it is also very biased too bad was once great
just like its website obamacare is a disastermaybe all those who are fighting it are wasting their time it will fail on its own
secy sebelius who was responsible for the horrendous obamacare rollout should resign or be firedrefuses to go before congress to explain
no wonder @nymag is doing so poorly with an idiot sr editor like @danamira it will only get worse
canadians kicked out the firm that the us paid all that money to for the failed website how stupid are our "leaders" this is a scandal

i love watching the dishonest writers @nymag suffer the magazine’s failure
our country is being run by total amateurs let’s just call it “amateur hour”

obamacare website fiasco was a single bid to a canadian company terrible
i build beautiful websites with very smart and imaginative people for almost nothing our government spent almost $535 000 000 for nothing
the contract to build the obamacare website was given to a canadian company for $55 744 081 it then bloated to $292 071067 incompetence
by the way new york state must lower taxes (and fast) and must start going after all of the "energy" that lies just below our feet (now)
thanks for all of the great support but i just don't see myself wanting to run for governor of new york i have something else in mind

@piersmorgan watch cnn tonight as piers and i discuss obama shutdown leadership and many other topics of interest 9 pm 10 minutes
i’ll be doing @piersmorgan show tonight on cnn at 9 pm will be very interesting (i hope)
obama has called @gop terrorists during this showdown it’s a shame he really doesn’t think it because then he would meet all @gop demands
the fact that we are here today to debate raising america’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure sen obama 3/16/06
obama’s job approval is at 37 percent a record low @gop and @speakerboehner have the leverage and momentum delay obamacare for all americans
obama can open the mall for illegals to protest our country yet he continues to barricade wwii memorial that’s an absolute disgrace
re florida power and light most important is safety but they have to also cater to aesthetics and not ruin the beauty of florida
i pay millions of $’s a year to florida power and light and they can’t give us what we want maybe a major class action suit against them
entrepreneurs who develop their midas touch do not work for money they work to create or acquire assets focus on assets
if the us government doesn't give the money necessary for the burials of our military personnel i willthe us under obama's leadership
it is outrageous and disgusting that families of us military personnel killed in action will not be given money for burials sad
with president obama it's all talk and no action our country is in desperate need of smart and decisive leadership before it is too late
i'm just so tired of listening to the same old rhetoric and words day after day from our president it's time to stop talking work
florida power and light has disgusting rotting utility poles outside doral in miami they should put in new ones or will be sued
in my opinion one of the worst utility companies in the country is florida power and light
did you ever think our country would become an economic basket case so much for hope and change
had a great time on @gretawire’s inaugural 7pm show congrats to greta on the new spot
@gop has leverage must stay united and on message
if you are steadfast in your efforts and self respect critics will be harmless keep your focus
expect the best from people they will rise to the challenge and it's important to inspire confidence
president obama wants to change the name of the "white house" because it is highly discriminating and not at all politically correct
president should not be telling the washington redskins to change their name our country has far bigger problems focus on themnot nonsense
my sense is that people are far angrier at the president than they are at congress re the shutdown an interesting turn
with the debt limit approaching @gop has even more leverage if they stay united and on message they can win
83 percent of the government is still running during the shutdown while 41 percent of nondefense federal workers are furloughed room for cuts
obama is tougher on wwii vets wanting to visit a dc memorial than iran he needs to show respect to our vets and not play games
government is shut down yet obama is now harassing the privately owned @redskins to change its namehe needs to focus on his job
standing strong for his people @govwalker is ignoring the feds and keeping all wisconsin parks open great
@kdawnpatterson while i never ran i thank you let's see what happens in the future
while the pres of iran tweets sweet nothings to obama he forbids the iranians to use twitter very revealing

wow three top microsoft investors want bill gates out as chairman do not like job he is doing
can you imagine with all of the talk about obamacare technical breakdowns made it a disastrous day our government is badly broken
it is crucial for republicans to remain united during this shutdown
there have been 17 shutdowns since 1976 14 under reagan and bush with democrat congresses who wanted more spending
it was an honor to be @gretchencarlson's inaugural guest on her new show ‘the real story’ gretchen will be a big success
obama has not passed a single budget in 4 years democrats don’t even vote them in congress he has failed to lead
obama and the democrats want this shutdown they think it helps their electoral prospects for 2014 don’t believe
achievers move forward at all times achievement is not a plateau it's a beginning
the republicans can absolutely win if they stick together but they are not sticking together sen mccain just said "we can't win"very bad
@danyellaangel thank you danyella if you would like to work there call jackie in my office (ny)
with proper thinking and leadership we can have a much better plan than obamacare something that works for the people and costs much less
obamacare is far toooo expensive far toooo complicated (thousands of pages) and most importantly doesn't work we can do much better
iran is toying with our president buying time and laughing at the stupidity of our leadership syria and now this what's next
re negotiation know exactly what you want and keep it to yourself think about what the other side wants and where they're coming from
don’t believe the manipulated job numbers walmart has just cut orders with suppliers because of rising inventory

obama wanted to meet with the iranian president yet the iranians denied the request so much for hope and change
remember what i previously said obama will someday attack iran in order to show how tough he is
can you believe the head of iran refused to meet with our great president zero respect
if justice roberts had made the correct decision on obamacare our country would not be in turmoil right now
@neneleakes nene asks me for advice and i am happy to oblige tonight at 900 on bravo (and watch her ratings go through the roof)

obama’s coal regulations will destroy the coal industry put americans out of work raise electricity prices and lead to blackouts

congratulations to @speakerboehner on standing strong and tying government shutdown to defunding obamacare
president obama must remember that the worst thing you can do in a deal is seem desperate to make it be cool move slowly and think iran

lightweight schneiderman's suit was filed on a saturday (unheard of) against a school with a 98 percent approval rating right after obama meeting

i fought hard against spitzer and weiner and both lost for a while when spitzer was way up it seemed that i was a lone voice good power
wow eliot spitzer has lost great news for new york city
bottom line i don't think president changed people's minds must hope for a lifeline from putin a very dangerous lifeline at that
we will have to see what russia's next move will be they may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess
he is working hard and for that he must be given credit

our economy is in trouble the unemployed are more likely to drop out of the workforce than find a job we need growth and now
iraq has granted iran full air rights to fly over and arm syria what did america accomplish with the iraq war and now syria
this week will mark the 1 year anniversary of the attack in benghazi that left 4 americans dead no answers

congratulations to @serenawilliams on her superb @usopen win she is terrific
@thebig_easy ernie you are doing a great job with #autismsupport glad to help see you at trump national jupiter

why are we fighting for the "rebels" that hate us only to save face for obama
doing fox and friends at 7 am
also great comeback by the new york jets that game was over until a really dumb defensive play by tampa amazing
tony romo just made a great play giants are getting killed
great comeback by tom brady new england
the new york giants are looking really bad so far tonight does not get much worse than this
do you notice that nobody is talking about the many scandals of the obama administration anymore the teflon president
my shirts ties and suits are selling great @macy's because they are the best and most stylish at a really reasonable price thanks
president obama do not attack syria there is no upside and tremendous downside save your "powder" for another (and more important) day
isn't it intetesting that anybody who attacks president obama is considered a racist by the real racists out there
speaking of our very stupid war with iraq it is totally disintegrating and iran (with russia) will walk in and take it over (lots of oil)
@lucindamac thank you but we are dealing with many very stupid people
i'm a republican but not a fan of the last george bush he also was a lousy president (iraq etc) in fact he was so bad he gave us obama
former president jimmy carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst president in the history of the united states
syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas a polititian's war
just watching nbc news where our potential attack is being detailed the exact ships the stealth bombers the destinations so ridiculous
obama is not a leader he's just a campaigner
many of the syrian rebels are radical jihadi islamists who are murdering christians why would we ever fight with them
the historic $250m renovations at @trumpdoral are moving on pace once complete @trumpdoral will be south florida’s premiere resort
i am not angry at russia (or china) because their leaders are far smarter than ours we need real leadership and fastbefore it is too late
i wonder how much our "leaders" have promised or given russia in order for them to behave and not make the us look even worse
really bad news just announced concerning jobs far fewer jobs created in august than anticipated interest rates therefore to remain low
we don't have the leadership including the generals (who just said the element of surprise does not matter) to attack anyone cool it
did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our president explaining what when and where to congress about a syrian attack far too late
we should not attack syria but if they make the stupid move to do so the arab leaguewhose members are laughing at us should pay
russia is sending a fleet of ships to the mediterranean obama’s war in syria has the potential to widen into a worldwide conflict
all former bush administration officials should have zero standing on syria iraq was a waste of blood and treasure
it will be interesting to see what happens to eliot spitzer if he loses the election for comptroller to very capable @scottmstringer
i have just lost my beautiful and elegant long time exec assistant norma foerderer she passed away yesterday – a truly magnificent woman
again to our very foolish leader do not attack syria if you do many very bad things will happen and from that fight the us gets nothing
tell congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world make america great again
the only reason president obama wants to attack syria is to save face over his very dumb red line statement do not attack syriafix usa
president obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about syria crossing the red line amazingly now he denies he said that
is anthony weiner a jerk or what
jay leno and his people are constantly calling me to go on his show my answer is always no because his show sucks they love my ratings

happy new year to all of my jewish friends and supporters shana tova hopefully it will be a great year
@gop must stay focused on defunding obamacare and the impending budget battle don’t let syria rule the agenda
@serenawilliams had a flawless @usopen quarterfinal win last night she’s a great player and a wonderful person
many syrian ‘rebels’ are radical jihadis not our friends and supporting them doesn't serve our national interest stay out of syria
congratulations to @piersmorgan on winning @britishgq tv personality of the year piers deserves his success
for all of those fools that want to attack syria the ushas lost the vital element of surprise so stupid could be a disaster
what i am saying is stay out of syria
the great generals macarthur and patton real leaders and fighters are spinning in their graves as we give syria info and time to prepare
how can general martin dempsey tell obama that delaying the syria bombardment will have no consequences he is no patton or macarthur
china opec and russia laugh at us but now thanks to obama so does syria very sad
president obama's "arab spring" is not looking so good right now
think of it the arab league doesn't want to get involved with syria but they want us to do their dirty work how stupid
if the us attacks syria and hits the wrong targets killing civilians there will be worldwide hell to pay stay away and fix broken us
our country is looking very bad right now
@arseniohall after arsenio won celebrity apprentice he told me in tears that i would be his first guest if he got a show no interest
eliot spitzer has failed at everything he has ever done and now he wants to be comptroller thrown out of politics and off of tv crazy
each time i see one of anthony weiner's television ads for mayor i ask what the hell is he doing just wasting money and time go get a job
we have given syria so much time and information there has never been such an instance in wartime history syria is now fully prepared
why isn't the arab league paying for everything and sending troops they want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves
the arab league stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on syria but they want us to attackare our leaders insane or just stupid
it is truly amateur hour at the white house and this is why we should not be doing the "war thing" right now
president obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on syria
be prepared there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into world war iii
china is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess they will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune and laugh at us
obama now just wants to save face russia is now telling him "don't do it" he waited too long and the other side is much better prepared
who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes call it the "plenty of notice war"
syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our "talk" they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locationsamazing
for the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what when and where they will be doing in a future attack
the president must get congressional approval before attacking syria big mistake if he does not
how bad has our "leader" made us look on syria stay out of syria we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize
if obama attacks syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed he and the us will look very bad
is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with syria our leaders don't know what they are doing
the ratings of the cycle on msnbc a sad and pathetic show are way down if they fired racist moron @toure a truly stupid guy they live
it's not that i'm so smart it's just that i stay with problems longer albert einstein
so a woman in chicago who never had a job has 9 kids with 7 different men (she is one of many) these kids will never work trouble
i hope everyone read the brilliant article in american spectator about leightweight ag eric schneiderman he should be run out of office
in that @timewarner has @hbo with really dumb racist bryant gumbel(and i mean dumb) and no cbs (which fired bryant) i am switching bldgs
people are really liking the new ties and shirts @macy's they are amazing and selling great
what will we get for bombing syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict obama needs congressional approval
congress must protect our borders first amnesty should be done only if the border is secure and illegal immigration has stopped
if christian bale turned down $50m to return as batman he should have his head examined what was he thinking
the yankees are sure lucky george steinbrenner is not around a lot of people would be losing their jobs
wow @cnbc ratings are really low worst in many years i guess i'll have to start doing my tuesday morning interviews with them again
the united states needs to fix its own problems of which there are many first
let the arab league take care of syria why are these rich arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack
if we are going to continue to be stupid and go into syria (watch russia) as they say in the movies shoot first and talk later
i wonder what the great generals like patton the big m or robert e lee would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack
@walaa_3ssaf no dopey i would not go into syria but if i did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools
that said the rich arab countries should get involved with the syrian mess not uswe should start rebuilding our own country and military
why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack syria why can't we just be quiet and if we attack at all catch them by surprise
i give the president's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10 not bad but room for improvement
why would anyone think obama would attack syria the day of his speech in washington he doesn't want to detract from his press and glory
do not settle for remaining in your comfort zone being complacent is a good way to get nowhere take control and move forward every day
young entrepreneurs – in an economic climate like this only the strong survive you can do it think big

what did our very stupid and ineffective ag eric schneidean during his trips to my office tell me about president obama and governor cuomo
after years of long stops then starts why did dopey eric scheiderman tell people in the trump org "this case is going awaywe have no case
how can an attorney general ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case a total sleazebag
why did lightweight ag eric schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions also recent asks
why is it that eric schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after jon corzine and big abusers for billions
why did failing ag eric schneiderman after years of looking file his pathetic lawsuit on a saturday afternoon (unheard of) no case
lightweight ag eric schneiderman who has been a total failure in office failed to report the 98 percent approval rating of students for courses

just tried watching modern family written by a moron really boring writer has the mind of a very dumb and backward child sorry danny
lightweight @dannyzuker is too stupid to see that china (and others) is destroying the us economically and our leaders are helpless sad
is it a coincidence that the middle east has blown up since obama became president
why isn’t the @gop congress doing everything possible to defund and cut obamacare
age wrinkles the body quitting wrinkles the soul general douglas macarthur
i can't resist hitting lightweight @dannyzuker verbally when he starts up because he is justso pathetic and easy (stupid)
@dannyzuker danny you're a total loser
looking forward to speaking at @ralphreed’s @faithandfreedom gala dinner on friday in dc his staff has been great

@go_onrob the show is a joke in comparison to the original apprentice but it does pay me a lot of money
@dblsolo700 not concerned about them weren't they brutally mugging people in the park go check your facts
likewise the primary victims of violent crimes are in the african american and hispanic communities these people want law and order now
when it comes to violent crime and if we are going to solve the problem we must stop being so politically correct must tell it like it is
sadly the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics a tough subject must be discussed
according to bill o'reilly 80 percent of all the shootings in new york city are blacks if you add hispanics that figure goes to 98 percent 1 percent white

@bollingsballs but i know @ericbolling and think he would do really well tough smart and a good guy
i commend roger ailes for publicly supporting @foxnews’ employees against the obama administration's intimidation of its reporters
who would be stupid enough to invest in @vattenfallgroup's ill conceived windfarm when it will lose £25m yearly
additionally two executives @vattenfallgroup are under major investigation and they are unable to get the many permits necessary
@vattenfallgroup lead investor in aberdeen windfarm fiasco has dropped out project not economically viable and protestors hate it
we spend billions of dollars helping nations all over the world but with hurricane sandy and oklahoma tornado not one nation helped us

@dannyzuker on your best day you can't come close to beating me i'll kick your ass every time take the bet danny (check with mf boss)
@bvogel56 i never went bankrupt just like buffett icahn kravis and paulson as you know

if @dannyzuker competed against me andwon (which not too many people do) he could win millions of $'s for himself or his charity
the lawyer i just beat in chicago was a buffoon but was a lot smarter and sharper than @dannyzuker come on danny make the bet
@dannyzuker is a weak and ineffective guy with a long string of failed shows who got his ass kicked last nighthe's afraid to make the wager
@therealkurse thank you i was dealing with a very bad person
@dannyzuker everyone is saying you are being beaten badly at this game but you can turn things around quickly if you will go for the deal

it should be mandatory that all haters and losers use their real name or identification when tweeting they will no longer be so brave
@julesmattsson wrong totally proved my case but didn't get damages because the libel laws in this country suck
great investor john paulson just sought bankruptcy protection for a unit of his hedge fund very smart but he didn't go bankrupt you morons

let's see whether or not chuck townsend @condenastcorp is smart enough to fire graydon carter who only cares about his bad food restaurants
mrs goldberg who filed the chicago case many years ago is a vicious and conniving woman loved beating her
thank you for all of the positive response on my chicago lawsuit victory yesterday most of you saw through the phony age card ploy
i loved beating these two terrible human beings i would never recommend that anyone use her lawyer he is a total loser

sadly firing can be an essential and responsible business decision it isn't pleasant but lopping off a branch can save a tree
a warren buffett corp is currently ensnared in a bankruptcy likewise icahn kravis apollo and many others have played the gamethanks
@menacesocietyut little jon stewart() is getting his ass kicked and you and all of his high priced writers know it don't panic jon
@jeremypage3011 mark cuban can't beat me at anything he is one of many on shark tank and apprentice has been a much much bigger show

@bobkurlander thanks bob it is one of the best and will only get better i will be spending lots of money this summer
wow i love stimulating debate and driving certain people crazy the generals were forced to do something they didn't want to do (not me)
is it even slightly possible that jodi arias could be set free wow what a miscarriage of justice that would be
the jury in the jodi arias trial is believe it or not still out you never know but such a long deliberation could be good for the defense
the generals and top military brass never wanted a mixer but were forced to do it by very dumb politicians who wanted to be politically c
26000 unreported sexual assults in the military only 238 convictions what did these geniuses expect when they put men and women together
26000 sexual assaults or rapes reported in military last year and that is just the number that is reported (many do not want to report)
sexual assault and rape in the armed forces is a massive problem that nobody wants to talk about or do anything about the big dark secret
head of air force's anti sexual assault unit arrested for sexual assault it just seems that our country is not what it used to be

time magazine should name david pecker of american media to be its top guybut they are not smart enough to do that
as i’ve said many times before jon stewart @thedailyshow is highly overrated
jon stewart @thedailyshow is a total phony –he should cherish his past not run from it
if jon stewart is so above it all and legit why did he change his name from jonathan leibowitz he should be proud of his heritage
what’s funny about the name “f**kface von clownstick” it was not coined by jon leibowitz he stole it from some moron on twitter
amazing how the haters and losers keep tweeting the name “f**kface von clownstick” like they are so original and like no one else is doing it

all star celebrity @apprenticenbc is down to the five final contestants getting fired now is when it really hurts
jodi if you're listening make a deal
jodi should try but the govt should not make a deal no jury could be dumb enough to let her off (but you never know look at oj and others)
jodi arias has stated that she follows me on twitter so i really hate to be saying that she is guilty but sadly she is as guilty as it gets

‏@richardroeper perhaps one of the worst replacements in showbiz once you went on it was over your taste sucks
@apprenticenbc season 13 still #1 at 10pm in all key demos despite having to serve as our own lead in from 9 10 11pm news loves trump
failed show @dannyzuker season 1 of @apprenticenbc had 28 million viewers and 415 million watching
 but you only want to talk about 10 years later when i still win 10pm in all key demos@dannyzuker
@dannyzuker i hear your filmography is "stacked" with failures
just out @apprenticenbc was in first place in all demos during the 10pm hour in the ratings

@vattenfallgroup doesn’t have the finances or financial statement to build the hated windfarm in aberdeen
@vattenfallgroup had no answers at demonstration last night it’s a failing company aberdeen windmills will destroy it
the sub station in blackdog is very dangerous on unregulated landfill fire hazard @alexsalmond @pressjournal
the council is concerned over the health and safety for the village of blackdog w/ placement of sub station @alexsalmond @pressjournal
the council was shocked by the exuberance of the demonstration in blackdog @alexsalmond @pressjournal
the entire village of blackdog in scotland protested to the council last night about the ugly windmills @alexsalmond @pressjournal
i believe lance armstrong had death wish when he did interview w/oprah as i predicted everybody is suing him he’ll have nothing left
by rejecting my ad on ugly windmills and @alexsalmond’s faulty thinking on the “lockerbie bomber” the ad is now on worldwide newscasts
watch out champion @joan_rivers returns to the boardroom as a judge in this week’s all star celebrity @apprenticenbc don't cross her
can someone explain to me how a chechnyan permanent resident non citizen in our country is planning jihad while on welfare
sen @maxbaucus has announced his retirement a major proponent of obamacare baucus now says it’s a ‘huge train wreck’
the boston killer applying today for obamacare he demands that medical bills be taken care of immediately does this include dental
as everybody knows but the haters and losers refuse to acknowledge i do not wear a “wig” my hair may not be perfect but it’s mine
i promise you that i'm much smarter than jonathan leibowitz i mean jon stewart @thedailyshow who by the way is totally overrated
@philstephen the scotland golf course in aberdeen is open and packed really cool to see and many are saying the greatest golf course ever built
the mother of the boston killers (not suspects) says her boys are totally innocent and were set up i can see the 14 year long defense now
lance armstrong just got sued by the federal government they want their money back i told you so what was he thinking when he did that int
scotland does not have free press even when you are just stating the facts it's crazy
@ruralbeeffarmer big pollution during manufacturing and building process
@rebeccaerin_ they were viciously attacking other people in the park nice guys
i have many great people but also an amazing number of haters and losers responding to my tweets why do these lowlifes follow nothing to do
the central park five documentary was a one sided piece of garbage that didn't explain thehorrific crimes of these young men while in park
@bitchforshort victim never died so they would not have been given death penalty but did you see what these "innocent" boys were doing
the chinese talk of climate change and carbon footprint but don't clean up their factories but they sell us the equipment to clean up ours
wrong used to be called global warming and when that name didn't work they deftly changed it to climate change because it's freezing
@helmjoshua wind turbines will quadruple your electric bills and destroy the value of your home lot's of chicken soup however bird kill
if your enemies end up liking you it’s because they beat you you want their respect not their friendship
next time you are waiting in an emergency room remember the boston killer was rushed to intensive care within minutes of capture
will barack obama personally read the boston terrorist his miranda rights
@thegarybusey survives another week of all star celebrity @apprenticenbc gary is shifty and playing to win
in light of boston immigration legislation will be much harder to get
@brandenroderick did a great job on all star celebrity @apprenticenbc raised a lot of money for charity while looking great
the boston killer will soon be asking for a presidential pardon don’t give it to him mr president hang tough
the big problem for little @macmiller is that he’s going to have to have another hit song not just his donald trump bonanza
@macmiller has over 79m hits on youtube and just hit platinum with his donald trump song screw you mac
me by a lot
will be doing fox and friends at 7 am (in 20 minutes)
@jbailey1987 yes we can oh foolish one terrorists should not have the right to remain silent
my ties and shirts are doing very big numbers @macy's beyond my wildest thoughts thanks @goangelo and the rest of the losers for mentions
what did you think of the boardroom #celebapprentice
george also appeared on saturday night live when i was guest host in 2004 a great time #celebapprentice
george ross and i have done some great real estate deals together he’s a tough negotiator #celebapprentice
looking forward to @thegarybusey's book of "buseyisms"
romance or adventure what do you prefer #celebapprentice
for you newcomers george ross was one of my first advisors on the original apprentice #celebapprentice
this assignment has been a challenge to both teams #celebapprentice
this assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of @lisarinna and @pennjillette #celebapprentice
george ross could be right @thegarybusey would be better in the adventure task than the romance task #celebapprentice
@traceadkins isn’t excited about their ideas are you #celebapprentice
@thegarybusey is making no attempt to help is he in buseyland their team is short on help already… #celebapprentice
how stressed are @lisarinna and @pennjillette already #celebapprentice
i hope you are watching the apprenticetonight's show is great and brett michaels is back
everybody loves @bretmichaels he’s a great champion and this is where he should be he agrees
@bretmichaels and george ross are back as advisors good to see them #celebapprentice
@traceadkins presents the nj coast red cross a $40000 check for sandy relief you can tell he’s very pleased about that and rightly so
seems like the teams are surprised when @thegarybusey comes back #celebapprentice
what do you think of water boarding the boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well i suspect he may talk
make the boston killer talk before our doctors make him better once he is well he will say "speak to my lawyers"
don't forget to watch celebrity apprentice tonight at 9pmyou will love it
i don't know how al michaels could have been drunk and arrested on friday night if he was totally sharp on saturday morning
great sportscaster al michaels a friend of mine played golf with me on saturday morning at trump national la he was in perfect shape
if the boston killer applies for obama care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand
no mercy to terrorists you dumb bastards
can you imagine the boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms legs and worse
bullshit pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and i built it into over 9 bill
you are right the media is always offending donald trump they have no limits but they will do anything not to offend the boston killer
i know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually i'm a very compassionate person (with a very high iq) with strong common sense
didn't the boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away we are not dealing with an innocent baby here death
when the stupid people start feeling sorry for the boston killer and want to release him and give him medals remember the killings maimings
i hate when the news media so afraid to offend anyone always refers to the boston killer as "the suspect"
the shirts and ties at macy's are so good beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece l kicked his ass
i just won a big court decision (ny post) against some character who claimed i owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties
oh no they are worried that they didn't read the boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument 12 year case to finish t
sorry the best and most beautiful ties and shirts made anywhere and at a really reasonable cost also fragrance is amazing go to macy's
great job by the fbi boston police and all others involved start the trial tonight
is the boston killer eligible for obama care to bring him back to health
read my tweets you dopes of course he should get a trial but fast (not a 12 year disaster)
you must be kidding zero chance he is innocent
get all the info then quick trial then death penalty for the boston killer of innocent children and people do not be kind
thinking small when you could think big limits you in all aspects of your life
druggie a rod @mlb’s biggest fraud is lucky george steinbrenner is no longer with us @yankees would have voided his contract
it is terrible that neither obama biden nor kerry attended lady thatcher’s funeral they would all run to muslim brotherhood morsi’s
business is easy dealing with people is hard if you are an entrepreneur your most important job is to choose who works with you
the chinese must still be laughing at kerry’s trip to china he got nothing gave them everything and promised even more
had a fantastic time at yesterday’s all star @apprenticenbc press conference with @stephenbaldwin7 in @trumptowerny
great to see @redsox win big yesterday good for boston and the country yesterday we were all @redsox fans
@larryrobertwyat our country needs a negotiator we are failing fast
i sure hope the sexting pervert anthony weiner runs for mayor will be great fun watching him both lose and be humiliated
negotiation is persuasion more than power be reasonable and flexible and never let anyone know exactly where you’re coming from
@alexsalmond rt @islandbluenose you'll be doing us in scotland a great service if you win good luck
the world economy is under deep stress with growth slowing everywhere yet crude is over $87/barrel should be $25 at the most
congratulations to @boston_police @fbiboston and all emergency first responders and doctors for their excellent work under fire yesterday
@ascotcarrental i know adam he's a great player and great guy
it’s very sad that the administration isn’t sending anyone to margaret thatcher’s funeral she was a big us supporter
i’ve known @hardball_chris for a long time and sadly he gets dumber each and every year and started from a very low base
@hardball_chris did you forget about bill ayers and so many others you should apologize to all the people you offended yesterday
@hardball_chris must have the lowest iq on television now telling people that domestic terrorists are from the right
do you think i made the right decision #celebapprentice
who do you think is going home #celebapprentice
product integration is very important #celebapprentice
i’m impressed both teams have produced very entertaining silent films #celebapprentice

ridiculous that they gave the 14 year old golfer from china a one stroke penalty for slow play at the masters(see i can stick up for china)
don't talk to me about bush i was never a defender or a fan
i can't believe we are not asking south korea for anything they make a fortune on us while we spend a fortune defending them how stupid

negotiation think about what the other side wants know where they’re coming from don't underestimate them create a win/win situation
re negotiation view any conflict as an opportunity be a diplomat as much as possible
look for good ideas outside of your own areas of expertise find innovations approaches and practices that you could adapt in your field
now ap is banning the term "illegal immigrants" what should we call them 'americans' this country's political press is amazing

a rod’s salary is more than the entire @astros half the players on @astros will have better seasons than him a rod is a joke

agreed @piersmorgan says he and @omarosa have a “communication malfunction” #celebapprentice
@liljon’s take on @piersmorgan seems to be a classic love hate combo piers can be tough and everyone knows it #celebapprentice
now he has made his busey ism into a song #celebapprentice

no i'm saying that the world is paying the price for china's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories very sad
major article in new york times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in china and how it is rapidly growng rest of world pays
china is the biggest environmental polluter in the world by far they do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity
we have tremendous economic power over china if our leaders knew how to use it which they don't china's economy would collapse without us
what do we get from our economic competitor south korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from north korea nothing
north korea is reliant on china china could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders
current @nymag really sad not only boring but highly inaccurate use better paper product looks like a death march (which it is)
have a great good friday and a happy easter
find out who and what is the best in your field identify the trendsetters leaders and authorities learn the standards they follow
achievers go for the challenge so the next deal is what they're thinking about they have an obligation to best themselves
wisdom comes as a result of both experience and knowledge it's something you can't teach someone else you have to achieve it on your own

take the time to be thorough in whatever you undertake remain open to new ideas remain fluid not fixed in your expectations
we blow up the famous blue monster at trump national doral onmonday in order to build a spectacular new bigger and better blue monster
@nymag new york magazine sucks lifeless and dead one of the most boring out there get it now it won't last long
adam moss editor in chief of @nymag is quickly losing his reputation in that @nymag has become so boring and so irrelevant
employees of @nymag should have their resumes updated it is very boring and will die in the near future how much are they losing now
at the same time go through a worst case scenario but keep it short focus on your goal look at the solution not the problem
practice positive thinking this will keep you focused while weeding out anything that is unnecessary negative or detrimental
once you consent to some concession you can never cancel it and put things back the way they are howard hughes

the new selection of ties shirts and suits at macy's is amazing also available in trump tower lobby
i'm doing the david letterman show tonight should be interesting
great piece on extra tonight re celebrity apprentice
sometimes we do things to build up experience and stamina to prepare but it's to prepare us for something bigger
many of @tigerwoods’ ‘friends’ were quick to abandon him in his time of crisis now tiger knows who he can count on
many people look at successful people and don't see anything but the end result they don't see all the work that went into getting there
when somebody challenges you fight back be tough
when someone can discourage you you probably aren't determined enough be resolute that's what it takes to get things done
and now alex salmond pushes ugly turbines
the scottish windfarm was conceived by the same mind that released terrorist al megrahi for humanitarian reasons 
…al megrahi was the man who blew up pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland
the radar defense shipping and civil aviation problems will stop the ugly windfarm #eowdc
the windfarm approval in scotland is subject to many conditions that can never be met will be tied up in courts for years #eowdc
@tigerwoods has made a truly great comeback he is number one again give him credit comebacks are tough to do way to go tiger
for all of my many jewish friends happy passover

let’s see what happens in the boardroom… #celebapprentice
@dennisrodman is always hard to miss especially when dressed in silver finery but not sure about the silver lipstick #celebapprentice
@joan_rivers  i know you’re watching what did you think of your impersonator
they should have got darrell hammond as the donald trump impersonator #celebapprentice
with @traceadkins on top of the truck the crowd definitely buzzed #celebapprentice
what do you think of @dennisrodman’s donald trump head the hair’s not quite right for one thing #celebapprentice
@omarosa admitting she’s a threat in the boardroom that’s not revelation knowledge #celebapprentice
@stephenbaldwin7 thinks @therealmarilu is ping ponging all over the place do you agree #celebapprentice
always good to have @arseniohall back as advisor as well as @donaldjtrumpjr they have their own fan clubs at this point #celebapprentice
@stephenbaldwin7’s mother thinks i’m very handsome now i see where stephen and alec get their smarts #celebapprentice
@latoyajackson and @omarosa are not likely to become friends –ever #celebapprentice
last week’s boardroom was truly epic and the dust hasn’t settled yet #celebapprentice
i will be tweeting live tonight during celebrity apprentice 9 o'clock on nbc

watching the madness in cyprus if our government keeps spending trillion dollar deficits that could happen here
this sunday's all star @apprenticenbc features some of the biggest fireworks of the entire season get ready
rt @ewerickson personally i think it is awesome that @realdonaldtrump listens to @dloesch on the radio she's awesome
@michellemalkin would be nothing without being on the @seanhannity show i don’t see what sean sees in her loser
when i think big which is often you can be sure i’m aware of the enormous amount of little things that we will have to account for
@1fos1 pay attention study more than what is required keep your focus on the big picture and good luck
see yourself as an organization pay attention to every facet of your life what’s strong what’s weak what’s missing
there won’t be any new gun legislation no surprise americans support the 2nd amendment
life always presents new opportunities you would never expect i hosted @wrestlemania and then i starred in one which sold most ppvs
make no mistake obamacare is the first step towards changing our health system into single payer just a disaster
problem with @gop is not their message it’s that they are incapable of controlling the message
yes all star @apprenticenbc contestant @thegarybusey is a little out there but he uses his ‘uniqueness’ to his advantage
it won’t stay a buyer’s market forever if you can take advantage and buy property asap you’ll thank me
remember the golden rule of negotiating he who has the gold makes the rules
it’s snowing and freezing in nyc what the hell ever happened to global warming
@mcuban mark nice picture thanks for the invite to the mavs/nets game next time i’ll go and you’ll win
celebrity apprentice on in 5 minutes on cnbc it's great
celebrity apprentice on cnbc tonight at 9
the @celebapprentice will be broadcast tonight on @cnbc at 9 pm
haters stop saying i went bankrupt it is not so i never went bankrupt
 but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage
for the haters out of hundreds of deals or transactions i have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool
 icahn kravis apollo and most others but nobody says they went bankrupt
people buy deals and immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals
 it is very effective and a commonly used business tool
why do the losers and haters always say i wear a “wig” when they know i don’t like it or not it’s all mine just ask barbara walters
my shirts ties and suits (and fragrance success) are doing great go over and check out macy’s now beautiful new selection
 @omarosa is smart and strategic people should cut her some slack and respect the way she works on @apprenticenbc
 @wwe’s @wrestlemania xxix less than 3 weeks away looking forward to being inducted into the hall of fame
the nfl has just barred ball carriers from using helmet as contact what is happening to the sport the beginning of the end

it’s a shame to hear that the @dcexaminer is failing no one wants the paper even if it is being handed out for free
@yokoono john was great everybody misses him best wishes
@nbc just announced that all 1 hour @celebapprentice episodes are being expanded to 2 hours it’s amazing what good ratings will do
i remained strong for @tigerwoods during his difficult period he rewarded me (and himself) by winning at trump national doral
@southjerseymag “according to the pros” just named trump national golf club philadelphia the #1 private club thanks
@hardball_chris’ very small audience is shrinking rapidly because people finally understand that he is very very dumb
you can have the best product in the world but if people don't know about it it's not going to be worth much the art of the deal
@mcuban mark okay with me but don't start your bullshit again
passion motivates passionate people don't give up; their zeal eliminates fear passion can also create business opportunities

amnesty is suicide for republicansnot one of those 12 million who broke our laws will vote republicanobama is laughing at @gop
@rnc report was written by the ruling class of consultants who blew the election short on ideas just giving excuses to donors
one of the most obvious lessons on @apprenticenbc is for the candidates to learn to think quickly think like a champion
does anyone remember the fight @mcuban had w/ the referee he was weak and pathetic a non athlete trying to live life thru his players
why do shows have @ananavarro ntl hispanic chair for the losing mccain ’08 and huntsman ’12 she’s a loser who doesn’t deliver votes
sorry folks but donald trump is far richer and much better looking than dopey @mcuban
all star celebrity @apprenticenbc continues to surprise our loyal viewers each and every week more and bigger coming…
it was just announced that @erinburnett won’t be going to mornings on cnn @outfrontcnn just made a wise decision
@sarahpalinusa did a great job @cpacnews much of what she said was plain old "common sense"
@hardball_chris became a super liberal obama fan only because he must need the money and on @msnbc that’s the way it is
@erinburnett should have stayed at cnbc she was never smart but people liked her @outfrontcnn jeff zucker’s got problems
for beauty and flight i’ll take the @boeing 757 over the @boeing 787 any day
l still think @boeing should just bite the bullet and get rid of the new batteries in the 787 those batteries will always be a problem
i don’t like seeing the pope standing at the checkout counter (front desk) of a hotel in order to pay his bill it’s not pope like
@hardball_chris is a really dumb guy(and i know him well) that’s why he works swimmingly with our leaders in washington
re cpac “the crowd in the main room filled to capacity by the end of trump’s address something his operative said he planned to do
 to help mcconnell who spoke right after him”@breitbartnews
i was sorry to decline headlining the reagan dinner last saturday due to a prior business commitment pres reagan was one of the greats
@rushlimbaugh played 3 separate audio bites (the most of anyone) of my cpac speech hour 3 in friday's show
be weak on immigration and ensure democratic victory
@rushlimbaugh is right the republicans lost because they weren’t conservative enough or tough enough
but @mcuban is physically weak he has no clubhead speed or game
@mcuban is so short off the tee he can't have much of a punch he's just a weak man with a big mouth
who is going to get iraq's oil
bombings all over iraq todaythat country is falling apart such a horrible waste of lives and 15 trillion dollars (and i told you so)
@mcuban is very short off the tee and his basketball sucks also
golf match i've won 18 club championships including this weekend @mcuban swings like a little girl with no power or talent mark's a loser
apprentice ratings doing great easily won the 10 o'clock hour over other networks
the blue monster is being torn up at trump @doralresort on april 1 i go out and play it one more time until the new course opens
@dloesch played great audio from my @cpacnews press conference on her radio show glad she made it
scotland will be so lucky if this monstrosity is not built i will tie them up in courts for years if necessary
vattenfall ceo stated that the company needed to prepare itself for falling electricity demands in coming years a changing market
vattenfall the company behind a proposed asinine windfarm off the coast of aberdeen scotland is having serious financial difficulty
if @omarosa is not in the board room i can’t fire her @latoyajackson made a strategic mistake
i will not be commenting on boardroom specifics would be unfair to the different time zones #celebapprentice
true @thegarybusey is a scene stealer without trying he’s got a gift #celebapprentice
@dennisrodman re @omarosa is right she’s becoming predictable
@omarosa is not winning points being called “the wicked witch of the mid west” and most certainly other things #celebapprentice
@omarosa’s new name via @dennisrodman “ms saboteur” sounds rather elegant #celebapprentice
@omarosa’s emergency has put a new spin on team power’s presentation but it’s not “show time” yet #celebapprentice
@latoyajackson informs @arseniohall that @omarosa is a “conniving witch” is he surprised are we surprised #celebapprentice
there’s no love lost between @latoyajackson and @omarosa disrespectful who is being disrespectful #celebapprentice
music cues audience participation sounds like a very active team power #celebapprentice
@omarosa on the cover of soap opera digest that’s a credential… #celebapprentice
and happy to welcome @arseniohall back as an advisor  he will have his own show and is doing great #celebapprentice
@traceadkins is back good news for plan b #celebapprentice
the paley center for media is a great place to visit when you’re in nyc #celebapprentice
@omarosa has another meltdown … while giving a check for $40000 to michael’s charity the sue duncan center #celebapprentice
great line from @thegarybusey “i am an angel in an earth suit” do you agree #celebapprentice
@omarosa’s meltdown was it for real @dennisrodman thinks she could be an oscar winner for that performance… #celebapprentice
the tournament at trump national doral was much more exciting than what is going on now

huff post "his early morning speech drew a large crowd far larger than remarks at the same time on thursday" and packed by end the facts
thanks for all of the accolades on my speech today it's all about the truth
honest reporters stated that the prayer breakfast was going on during my cpac speech and security was very slow to let people in long lines
i agreed to take the worst spot at cpac because nobody else wanted it and it was the only time i could be there it was great fun
why can't the media tell the truth we would all be so much better off
for accurate reporting of my @cpacnews speech read @politicalticker @newsmax_media @politico @huffpostpol
@dailycaller @breitbartnews @drudge_report and @gatewaypundit
@jheil at @nymag is such a pathetic reporter who doesn’t want to know the truth a total obama flunky and hack
boring and failing @nymag’s 3rd rate political reporter @jheil had flunky @danamira write a totally false report about me today
 he knows i don’t respect him
i watched the last two minutes of the @dallasmavs game last night i just loved watching them lose
press conference after cpac speech this morning was excellent lots of very professional reporters
the cpac speech went really well this morning first speaker standing ovation i really enjoyed it
when you think big you will automatically trigger more details because details are the major component of making anything big
in the general course of human nature a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will alexander hamilton
@mcuban has less tv persona than any other person i can think of he’s an arrogant crude dope who met some very stupid people
those stupid people bought @mcuban's company (of which he owned a piece)
there’s a reason @mcuban’s partners can’t stand him and on top of that the team sucks
cpac attendees and fellow patriots lines for my @cpacnews start at 700am outside the potomac ballroom make sure to get there early
really big crowd expected tomorrow morning at # cpac2013 i look forward to it
when @mcuban had his own show the benefactor it totally “bombed”
i love watching dummy @mcuban promote on ok show named shark tank but he is just a small part of that show
good move by @msnbc in downgrading @wegoted to a dead weekend spot this is truly a guy who shouldn't be on tv
 @barbarajwalters made a great decision in firing @joyvbehar from @theviewtv the show will be better without her
congratulations to my catholic friends on the selection of pope francis i to lead the catholic church people that know him love him
to show you how shallow politicians can be many are jealous of my @cpacnews speaking slot and also their fellow republicans not good
the dc press corps is obsessed with my @cpacnews speech which is scheduled tomorrow 845am in the potomac ballroom can't blame them
wow just 1 day after my offer to fund all wh tours "obama backtracks on decision to cancel all white house tours” 
dummy @mcuban made up a story about a visit to mar a lago last night on leno it never happened i don’t talk that way
congrats to @erictrump and @laraleayunaska on a great five years
i watched mark cuban on jay leno last night what a jerk
celebrity apprentice will be rebroadcast tonight at 9 on cnbc
do your homework wasting other people’s time due to poor planning and thoughtlessness will only leave a bad impression

@annamplf the art of the deal and think like a champion would be helpful
@lukedonald you are so good and so talented that i have no doubt you will conquer the 18th hole at the "new" blue monster @doralresort
@cpacnews had its largest ever ticket sales the day of my announcement really an honor can’t wait to see everyone
the sequester is less than 2 percent of total 2013 budget why can’t the wh re allocate funds and keep the tours open for children #openourwh
lines for my @cpacnews address start at 700am outside the potomac ballroom acu has asked that you get there early #cpac2013
it’s sad that the wh is punishing children from across the country by closing all tours doesn’t have to be wh should take my offer
if you love what you do you are going to work harder you are going to try harder and you will be better at it think big

re omarosa nasty tough or smartor all
does anyone agree with marilu that gary while 'adorable' is a distraction
omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept and presentation
next she says she's being set up by omarosa to fail is somebody confused
what latoya is saying omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met
on the whole the teams seem to be working well together no warsyet
gary as the cat in the hat he can work it out
what do you think of gary's definition of f u n

firing bret was a tough one for me but omarosa doesn't seem to mind
omarosa always promises and delivers high drama

it was just announced that @macmiller’s song “donaldtrump” went platinum tell mac miller to kiss my ass
building a brand is like building a skyscraper the foundation comes first the bigger the building the deeper the foundation needs to be
it is my great honor to be speaking at cpac 2013 they are all about what's good for america
it’s important to promote an image of yourself each and every day it’s part of having a sense of self and a sense of purpose

the formula of knowledge the best way to learn is through studying the history of success and failures in your industry
@kennybud if you love what you're doing motivation is never a problem

@scheekster i agree it's a beautiful course to play thanks
rory tiger phil and ernie will be fun to watch this weekend at trump national doral
heading to trump national doral to check the progress prior to the start of the cadillac championship on thursday i’ll be there all week
for those of you defending bret and saying omarosa should go remember bret chose o which could also be considered a big mistake
3 you should tweet your pick for mvp using the celebrity’s name followed by the hashtag #celebapprenticemvp
2 the celebrity with the highest totals by tuesday noon et gets an extra donation to his or her charity…
1 each week you the audience can choose an mvp among the celebrities @celebapprentice using twitter…

glad everyone could see mar a lago last night on @datelinenbc it is the crown jewel of palm beach
brande was also smart in not bringing omarosa to the boardroom
brande would have been fired immediately if she didn't raise $132000 a really large sum bret on the other hand raised very little
i will be doing fox and friends at 7 am this morning
so what did you think of my decision what would you have done #celebapprentice
i'll always like @omarosa because she constantly defends me #celebapprentice
@piersmorgan is right he won the show because “i know how to play the game” #celebapprentice
@ivankatrump looks like a movie star from the days of glamour and beauty #celebapprentice
don't worry west coast etc we are not going to tweet who was fired or give any indication there of until after it airs #celebapprentice
paul teutul is always good on the show #celebapprentice
even @piersmorgan is impressed by @thegarybusey #celebapprentice
@omarosa as a cashier a big mistake by @brandenroderick #celebapprentice
@kellyandmichael are both wonderful people their show is terrific #celebapprentice
@dennisrodman must be thinking of north korea #celebapprentice
@thegarybusey is definitely different #celebapprentice
@piersmorgan and @omarosa really hate each other #celebapprentice
@ivankatrump and @piersmorgan will be wonderful advisors #celebapprentice
i can’t believe he would choose @omarosa as his first choice she is hard to handle #celebapprentice
@lisarinna looks better with her reduced lips good move lisa #celebapprentice
looks like @omarosa is up to the challenge #celebapprentice
how does this cast look to you pretty amazing #celebapprentice

do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail ralph waldo emerson
are you a democrat running in a race you should lose get @karlrove to run an ad against you and you will win
you haven’t seen fireworks until you see @omarosa and @piersmorgan go at it again let’s just say it’s no happy reunion…
over the years i've discovered that for a brand to build the people surrounding it have to work exceptionally well together
one good aspect of the obama depression is that it will separate the winners from the losers if you can make it now you deserve it
remember no one ever said success was easygood luck doesn’t come overnightbut if u work hard and love it u will find success and luck
i am very proud of @stephenbaldwin7’s performance in the record 13th season of all star @celebapprentice watch
everyone is excited for @thegarybusey’s return to all star @celebapprentice be warned this time gary is even more insane

on jimmy fallon tonight
dopey @billmaher still owes me $5m for charity i hope he pays up before @hbo fires him which will happen
looking forward to the @cadillacchamp at trump doral next week 36 310 can’t wait to meet the attendees #wgcdoral
@tedcruz must be doing something right if @cher sadly rated “the 4th ugliest celebrity” according to @listverse is attacking him
you have to feel bad for the democrat senators they don’t want hagel either just following obama’s orders
the ruling @gop consultant class of losers like @karlrove have no respect for the tea party they do this at their own peril
but why shouldn't i speak out don't you speak out in this country george steinbrenner

i will be on @latenightjimmy tonight always have a good time with @jimmyfallon now we know he will get high ratings tonight
one of the reasons i assume i was inducted into the @wwe hall of fame is that vince mcmahon and i have the all time highest ratings
 and pay per view records with “battle of the billionaires” in detroit it was a wild day
it is a great honor for me to be inducted into the @wwe hall of fame this will take place on april 6
 at madison square garden followed by a ceremony with 80000 people at metlife stadium wrestlemania
thanks go angelo people are now really aware of my ties shirts and cuff links at macy's 
you keep forgetting to mention the fragrance "success"
a certain whack job go angelo who doesn't have a life spends his time hopelessly attacking me re macy's
 i wonder if angelo has a job or is on assistance in any event i'm sure he is a nice guy
when employees are working at home they can never have the same cohesivness as working together as a group
 also if they’re at home who the hell knows what they’re doing (a second job maybe)

shark tank is a dead friday night filler compared to the apprentice which has been number one show for week in the t v ratings
our leaders are terrible the government spends over $50b a day it can’t find cuts for less than 2 days of spending sad
the countdown is on the 13th season of all star @apprenticenbc premieres this sunday march 3rd at 9pm est on @nbc big
the $85b sequester is just 2 percent of obama's $35t record deficit spending budget our leaders are ruining our children's future
obama is making speeches excoriating the republicans and they never answer back why aren’t they fighting
@marissamayer is right to expect yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs working at home she is doing a great job
an individual whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns has turned his attention to me
so far he has been a complete failure at doing so he should read the art of the deal and use his energy to focus on a new career
the media is so in the tank for obama that it is amazing the funny thing is he can’t stand them
speaker john boehner who i like should never have agreed to raise taxes because the republicans got absolutely nothing for it
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool
people buy deals and immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals
 it is a very effective and commonly used business tool
whenever one of the morons say i wear a wig stop reading because they have no credibility and just hate
why do losers and haters always say i wear a “wig” when they know i don’t like it or not it’s all mine just ask barbara walters
how did you like michelle obama’s bangs last night
last night william shatner had more airtime than any winner it should have been called the william shatner show

dummy goangelo keep letting people know how great my shirts ties and cufflinks (also success) are at macy'sthe best now everyone's aware
come on goangelo don't give up now just because your "rally" at macy's drew only eleven people for twenty minutes i love@ macy's
by popular demand i will be tweeting on the very tainted academy awards tonight
i'm saying that the tea party perhaps by another name will soon have another big moment and will be a major factor in victory
why didn't movie lincoln use ford's theater for big scene instead of the stage of an unrelated theater
big response to my tea party statement remember they were never fully energized by romney campaign and will have far more power with time
republicans better start listening to and respecting the tea party
i hope oprah gives lance armstrong 100 million dollars because that's what that ridiculous interview will cost him

gain and use information to your advantage see every day as an opportunity to learn
pay attention to global news and developments in today's world that is a requirement not an elective
@amitchellmo recognize the opportunity focus on it and don't give up luck is often earned
when will people realize that @billmaher is not an intellectual but actually a rather dumb guy just look at his past
every business has surprises hidden dangers beneath the surface and little known opportunities that can lead to huge success
ny should frack now what’s the hold up is albany opposed to creating jobs and making gas cheaper for middle class
i went to wharton made over $8 billion employ thousands of people and get insulted by morons who can’t get enough of me on twitter
@carsenadeline yes absolutely there are always opportunities and therefore hope good luck carsen
check @billmaher’s background and you will find he is not a smart guy he just wants people to think he is just call him dummy
i don’t know what will happen with the lawsuit against dummy @billmaher but have an obligation to charity to bring it
surprised @eagles signed michael vick yesterday to be their 2013 qb vick is talented but brittle and probably won't last long

i endorsed a book on obamacare and it just went to #2 on the new york times bestseller list
what do you think of my suing @billmaher for $5m for charity he made an offer i accepted
can you imagine if @billmaher said about obama what he said about me (orangutan etc) the press would run him out of the country
 but @billmaher is allowed to say that about me

@karlrove is far more to blame for obama's victory than the tea party
i don’t like bullies i am not going to stand around and watch @karlrove target the tea party karl rove gave us barack obama loser
congratulations to my friend @roccomediate on winning the big golf tournament today
@billmaher's so called show on hbo must be the cheapest "special" produced in the history of television it sucks
how does @hbo employ @billmaher with a pathetic show that he does  what kind of "a special" is that complete garbage
dummy @billmaher forgot to say that he made an absolute offer which i accepted hopefully charity gets $5m dollars
no person who is enthusiastic about his work has anything to fear from life samuel goldwyn
being an entrepreneur is not a group effort you have to trust yourself and your instincts
@karlrove’s ad is the best thing that ever happened to ashley judd simply increases her profile
see the ashley judd ad by @karlrove and you will definitely vote for her and love obama
@karlrove ashley judd ad makes her and obama look greatnobody wastes money like karl rove
is @karlrove incompetent 400 million dollars down the drain and not 1 victory
the dollar always talks in the end although our pols are killing the dollar
can you imagine if bush’s administration drafted a memo legalizing the killing of americans democrats are such hypocrites
china keeps manipulating its currency at our financial expense why do our leaders continually let china run all over us

why are people giving money to karl rove when he just wasted $400m without any victories use your head
@erikcantu even better government kills by drones but we can't even own guns thanks erik
@pennjillette thanks penn will be interesting see you soon
knowledge requires patience; action requires courage put patience and courage together and you’ll be a winner
keep the big picture in mind there are always opportunites and possibilities and thinking too small can negate a lot of them
democrats try so hard to mock and belittle republicans and the republicans just don’t fight back no energy
obama can kill americans at will with drones but waterboarding is not allowed only in america
people like doing deals with me because they know it will be profitable that i work quickly and that they will be treated fairly
be tough be smart be personable but don't take things personally that's good business

immigration reform really changes the voting scales for the republicans for the worse

is gov @bobbyjindal the stupid one for using the phrase “the stupid party” when referring to the republicans
gov @bobbyjindal referred to the republicans as “the stupid party” now he has given dems a phrase to use
spain's government is closing down wind turbines the maintenance is higher than the income
maybe i’m old fashioned but i don’t like seeing women in combat
lots of people are asking whether or not i should have run for president stay tuned for the answer
president obama's inaugural had record low ratings what does that portend
@lisarinna is at the top of her game in the upcoming season of @celebapprentice all stars our fans love her

@gretawire greta you’re wrong kirsten powers is a dummy wasn’t she anthony weiner’s girlfriend
by continuing to give massive subsidies to scotland’s ugly wind turbines @david_cameron is playing right into @alexsalmond’s hands
@corymacrae yes i am i am saving it from wind turbine destruction
today’s assignment read chapter 7 ‘trump tower the tiffany location’ of the art of the deal focus on how i marketed the property
has pres obama or the white house told the public what happened in algeria yet where’s the media
the tea party delivered the house for @gop so they could be fiscally responsible instead they have been irresponsible
one positive from last week for lance was that everyone was focused on manti te'o why did lance do that interview
republicans are always worried about their general approval with proposing to 'ignore the debt ceiling' they are ignoring their base
the worst negotiators in history (otherwise known as republicans) have just offered to suspend debt ceiling for four months pathetic

you must promise that you will never cheat off manti te’o’s test papers
@moorereva thanks myriam starts on sunday march 3rd @nbc at 9 pm est
part of obama’s new found confidence is that the republicans aren’t using their power of ideas properly or effectively
obama’s speech indicates he wants to change this country as we know it wow he really feels emboldened
if the republicans need a chief negotiator i am always available or can recommend some really good ones
republicans don’t extend the debt ceiling make the great deal now
the president’s speech was very combative toward republicans they have obviously not earned his respect
socialists think profits are a vice; i consider losses the real vice winston churchill
glad to hear @insideedition has hired @_katherinewebb to cover @superbowl she will be absolutely terrific miss usa pageant is proud
get ready for the fireworks between @omarosa and @latoyajackson in 13th season of all star @celebapprentice neither one will back down

i wish president @barackobama the best of luck in his second term
wownyt reports @celebrityapprentice was the number 1 show in branding on television for all of 2012

all time hit leader pete rose should now be in the baseball hall of fame he has paid his penalty
@boeing stock went way down because of 787 so i just bought stock in @boeing great company
the interview with oprah will cause lance armstrong huge legal and financial problems sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide
i'll bet lance armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with oprah he's saying to himself "what was i thinking"
@hbo should fire @billmaher and bring back @dennisdmz someone that is actually funny
@billmaher’s show is great for helping me get to sleep better than sominex
@billmaher needs to cut back on the pot and maybe he will stop making offers he can’t afford
dumbass @billmaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity we just presented him with a demand notice
brent musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking he is much more popular now than before
@espn’s apology(brent musburger) was a disgrace to broadcasting stop being so politically correct
imo manti te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the heisman trophy
can it just be new age that manti te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax
not believable that manti te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met she then died he is either very stupid
or mentally troubled (or a con)
congratulations to tom scocca and timothy burke of @deadspin for exposing the manti te’o fiasco
look i have always liked lance armstrong i just hated what he did to himself including recently his life will now be hell
lance armstrong made a really big mistake by opening up to oprah i’ll bet he wishes he had the chance to do it over again
lance armstrong was given very very bad advice
journal news readership is already down 50 percent over the years
if everybody sued the journal news for revealing their info (guns) paper would go out of business
@billmaher has not respondednot a word his lawyers must have told him to shut up
china watched obama’s press conference yesterday salivating we will be borrowing trillions more from them
glad to hear derek jeter just removed his boot and is practicing on the field for @yankees derek is a true champion
our country under president obama is on life support great leaders must bring people together
re lance armstrong not only was it a big lie but a big lie that lasted too long
does anyone really believe that chuck hagel is sorry for any of his past comments or supports israel
still waiting for a response from @billmaher does he even have $5 million
sadly i’m probably helping @billmaher’s lowly rated show but charity will benefit by $5 million so it’s worth it
@nbc did a great job last night with the @goldenglobes
back by popular demand @latoyajackson returns to the 13th season of all star @celebapprentice she is fierce in the board room
just as i predicted today obama called for even more tax increases the republicans played right into his hands and blew their cards
can you imagine if obama had to give today's press conference before the election he would have lost @gop really blew it
according to many and while nominated i would have won the emmy many times except for my politics @primetimeemmys
lance armstrong is now going to admit guilt can that be possible after many years of denying just go away lance
is @billmaher the dumbest man on television i think so
by the way folks @billmaher is not a smart guy (just look at his past) he just pretends he is
dopey @billmaher is in for a lot of trouble i hope he has $5 million (for charity)
i am a handwriting analyst jack lew’s handwriting shows while strange that he is very secretive not necessarily a bad thing
the republicans have been played into a trap by the president they forgot the 14th amendment
and will be very embarrassed unless they get smart fast
i can’t believe @denver_broncos allowed final touchdown dumbest defensive play i have ever seen in football

it’s amazing that people can say such bad things about me but if i say bad things about them it becomes a national incident
apparently @martinbashir said something about me on his show yesterday i was surprised to find out he is on tv who knew
i hope @billmaher pays quickly so that this money can immediately be given to the charities
the charities i have designated for @billmaher's donations are police athletic league new york march of dimes hurricane sandy victims
american cancer society and the dana farber cancer center
i have accepted @billmaher’s $5 million offer paid to me for charity (made on the @jayleno show)
lawyers have sent @billmaher demand notice and necessary documentation

what a great couple katherine webb and aj mccarron they are both winners

congratulations to @alabamaftbl on winning the bcs championship last night
glad to hear my @foxandfriends’ monday interview continues to get big ratings great way to start your week
nominating chuck hagel for sod is the wrong move for obama he doesn’t need the fight too much political capital will be wasted
i hope the republicans are happy just as i predicted that stupid deal they voted for only whetted obama’s appetite for more taxes
trump invitational at mar a lago was a huge success raised millions for charity and was the 1st equestrian event held in palm beach

wealth comes from big goals and sustained action toward those goals every day think big
@chartranda yes i thought romney would do better just didn't catch on
@nicksteinmetz try never give up for lessons in tenacity
just shows that you can have all the cards and lose if you don’t know what you’re doing
i’ll bet obama now uses the amendment for the debt ceiling
@markghuneim something used on occasion by many of the world's greatest businessmen
the trump organization is going revolutionize rio de janeiro’s downtown port area with trump towers construction begins soon
republicans had all the cards but not the guts to make a great deal
great to see sec clinton leaving the hospital yesterday with @chelseaclinton and pres clinton glad she is recuperating
so obama and congress can waste billions in iraq and afghanistan building roads and schools but can’t get money to the nj and ny sandy victims
the republicans look so weak and foolish what the hell are they doing
the boardroom has never been as intense as in the upcoming13th season of all star @celebapprentice premieres march 3rd on @nbc
i can't believe republican leadership allowed such a stupid deal to be made they are rapidly giving up all of their cards
@gretawire greta don't let it get you down you are a winner and tina is not
@rgiii and @dangerusswilson and luck are very special players will be great playoff games
this ‘deal’ @rnc voted for has $41 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts it is pathetic obama is laughing at them
make sure you realize that this ‘deal’ is only a stop gap measureobama will be looking to raise even more taxes in the coming negotiation
remember i told you so
obama's deal raises taxes on 77 percent of national households with obama care taxes kicking in now everyone will be paying for his 2nd term
@gop’s election loss and failed negotiations will serve as a case study in how third parties come about
the republicans must face reality and create a strong and positive immigration policy if not they will continue to lose elections
congratulations to @robinroberts on celebrating 100 days in her bone marrow transplant recovery robin is a special person

@opus_6 thanks it's a wonderful place to be and happy new year
@earther57 sounds nice and thanks happy new year to you and yours
raising the capital gains tax in this fragile economic time is the dumbest thing washington could do so they will probably do it
i always enjoy watching young entrepreneurs enter the business world i can tell who reads my books and who doesn’t #midastouch
once again obama is going to lose on another prospective nomination chuck hagel will not be named sec of defense and probably shouldn't be
obama wants taxes to go up so he can take credit for lowering them next year
any deal completed before the fiscal curb must have tangible cuts on expenditures in baseline spending so we can get our credit back
the republicans once again hold all the cards with the debt ceiling they can get everything they want focus
spolier alert…the record setting 13th season of all star @celebapprentice also features the return of previous winners in the boardroom
true courage is being afraid and going ahead and doing your job anyhow that's what courage is gen norman schwarzkopf (1934 2012)
sorry to hear of yesterday’s passing of general norman schwarzkopf he was a terrific general and leader we could use more like him
@ptlyons thank you wishing you and yours a happy new year too
republicans remember debt ceiling debt ceiling debt ceiling be smart and you will win
it’s thursday how much time did washington waste today trying to find a solution on the so called fiscal cliff
i told the republicans the debt ceiling talks should come before election and we would have a republican president they wouldn’t listen
i hate hearing after all of the hard work that @mittromney never wanted to become president

for those of you in trouble (in these troubled times) never ever give up
re real estate you don’t necessarily need the best location what you need is the best deal…
…you can enhance location through promotion and work
re life life is very fragile and success doesn’t change that if anything success makes it more fragile

negotiation tip #2 i always go into the deal anticipating the worst
if you plan for the worst if you can live with the worst the good will always take care of itself
negotiation tip #1 the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it
china is buying so many of our companies it’s really getting bad

remember to watch the series finale of "the men who built america" this sunday at 8/7c on @history
china's communist party has now publicly praised obama's reelection they have never had it so good will own america soon
at the end of the day obama won the battleground states by less than 500000 votes this was a winnable race gop needs to do better

@mcuban letterman @late_show had his best ratings with me and you bombed people don't care about mark cuban
after 13 seasons @apprenticenbc easily beat shark tank in ratings last year better demos as well
@mcuban shark tank was shoved to friday evening friday is considered “dead television” besides you are not the star (and never will be)
obama just stated "it's always good to ignore donald trump" i state he is right especially when the truth is against him
@mcuban baseball commissioner and owners were smart when they didn’t want you to buy a team but i don’t think you have the money anyway
i believe in the america that never gives up never stops striving never ceases believing in itself @mittromney 11212
via @wsj “a new direction for america” by @mittromney
like al sharpton @donnydeutsch apologized to me for calling me a racist on @todayshow apology accepted
don't believe chrysler (if obama wins) see how fast @jeep production will be moved to china and i'll be watching
@mcuban when apprentice became the #1 show on tv you tried copying me with the benefactor a complete and total ratings disaster for @abc
only 1 mill dollars @mcuban offer me real money and i’d consider it your team and networks lose so much money i doubt you have much left
dummy @mcuban is at it again trying to use me to get publicity for himself
in ’08 america voted for hope and change instead we got incompetency now it is time to put a real job creator in office vote 4 mitt
we can't destroy the competitiveness of our factories in order to prepare for nonexistent global warming china is thrilled with us
it’s extremely cold in ny and nj not good for flood victims where is global warming
@cnn is looking at jeff zucker to lead them out of the forest jeff would be a great choice

obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years 4 more years
undecideds in ohpa and wi will make the difference all should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under obama
pennsylvania is in play @mittromney all undecideds in philly suburbs should ask themselves who do you trust most on @israel
i think @thereval should take this challenge axelrod was too scared rt @ronkaufmanintrn kaufstache vs sharpstache
considering obama hasn’t proposed anything concrete if he wins he won’t have a mandate another 4 years of legislative stalemate
castro chavez and ahmadinejad are all anxiously awaiting our election results they are praying obama wins
obama promised 52 percent unemployment by october 2012 his promises are worthless
go as far as you can see; when you get there you'll be able to see farther jp morgan
make sure to catch @history’s season finale of “the men who built america” on sun november 11th great show
reality tv’s #1 bad girl @omarosa is back on the upcoming 13th season of all star @celebapprentice she is great as always
could be the hurricane helps @mittromney people are rioting in the streets over gasoline
obama has destroyed the middle class in ’09 median household income was $55198 now it is $50678 four more years
i have an idea for a rod buy a home at @trumpgolfla overlooking the pacific will bring you better luck
a rod is now looking for an expensive home in beverly hills why aren't the @yankees terminating his contract for misrepresentation
@eagles should sit michael vick he is a great athlete but less than average quarterback
we don't need a secretary of business to understand business we need a president who understands business and i do @mittromney
unemployment is now 79 percent four years and $65t later that is really bad
how about president obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction
interestingly the hurricane may now be a disaster for obama's reelection because of his grandstanding
people are struggling to get gasoline for their cars we are like a third world country
i'm sending lots of bottled water out to staten island and long island
@thereval came to my trump tower office to apologize for calling me a racist very nice apology accepted
@barbarajwalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her sadly i won't be able to do it
@ralphgilles of chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language not very professional
we should not allow @chrysler to move @jeep jobs to china after they said they wouldn't stay tuned
@chrysler disputes my statement but watch chrysler move @jeep jobs to china after the election
with long gas lines and total disarray from storm the hurricane may yet be a negative for obama
it was announced this morning that unemployment rose this can't be good for obama
next year i will be changing the name of 800 acre doral to trump national doral it will be the best resort in the country miami is hot
i will start reviewing various political reporters etc and websites as to their professionalism and fairness many people asking for this
how could obama leave those american heroes out to die in benghazi and he continues to lie to the public
what is your thought as to why obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications
nice to see obama released a situation room photo from sandy how about releasing the photo taken during benghazi
everybody knows why obama would not show his college applications  they are just not willing to say
if i would have offered obama a billion dollars to show his records he would have refused
i will soon be releasing my response to the fact that president obama refused to show his applications and records to the public
president obama missed the deadline
obama is a terrible negotiator he bails out chrysler and now chrysler wants to send all jeep manufacturing to china and will
why is obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in china he is ruining american industry
to all @mittromney supporters make sure you have taken advantage of early voting now so you can gotv on election day
you know the world is crazy when new york gets hit by a hurricane and florida doesn't
let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories and manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming china is so happy
do you believe @algore is blaming global warming for the hurricane
from 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the east coast
it's 10 am two hours to go for obama to easily pick up millions for charity
the successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way dale carnegie
obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a president give me a break
a lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5m will be donated to the onus is on obama to first release his records
president obama if it is important to you i will substantially increase the $5m offer
president obama please take the $5m check for charity tomorrow it is so easy and could do so much good
thanks for all the nice words on my keeping the trump tower atrium accessible to stranded victims of #sandy my honor
congratulations to @mittromney on getting the @dmregister @newyorkpost @newyorkobserver and @nashuatelegraph endorsements
spoiler @dennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of @celebapprentice
how does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show and his ratings stink you'd think @hbo could do a lot better
a lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with obama’s lack of transparency i don't blame them
there is nothing i would be happier to do than to donate the $5m to a charity of obama’s choice once he releases all of his records
@disney's acquisition of lucas film is a smart deal for both sides disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue
in the spirit of transparency obama should immediately release the 911 tape of tyrone woods pleading for military support in benghazi
today barack obama is standing in water in nj remember on election day that he has put the us underwater
congratulations kevin gabriel on your amazing article if i were a journalist this would be the next watergate and i would be a star
@oreillyfactor called me a "master marketeer" last night i am not i am a great builder i build great things and people come
kevin garnett's response to ray allen last night was that of a great competitor nothing wrong in fact it was terrific a champion
i was standing with @shaq when a young high school star kevin garnett @celtics said to a crowd "forget shaq i want to meet donald trump"
i'm not hearing much from obama or his administration about my $5m offer to charity or to which charity the money will go
the president has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5m for his favorite charity looking like he won't be doing it what is he hiding
the polls and momentum are trending towards @mittromney don't let the hurricane change your thinking
fans shouldn't worry we have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @celebapprentice appropriately due to the storm
maybe obama should donate my $5m to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm
scary obama and the democrat senate have accrued over $5t worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years 4 more years
why does obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition hiding something
glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co hosting the grammy nominations special on 125 taylor is terrific
let’s be honest if obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm then he would have been in ohio on monday
how did obama go to a las vegas fundraiser on 912 the day after he refused to send help to americans in benghazi
without focus it's just impossible to be successful at anything midas touch
i never fall for scams i am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘ali g’ interview
another great cause obama could send my $5m donation to is a charity for 9/11 first responders they are american heroes
these last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4 percent gdp obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in american history
the election is trending towards @mittromney americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the obama economic decline
the trump tower atrium is such a great place and kept thousands of people warm and safe during the storm thanks staff
remember this obama wants to raise taxes @mittromney wants to lower taxes need i say more
don't let obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states
i am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap i would have been lambasted from coast to coast
because of the hurricane i am extending my 5 million dollar offer for president obama's favorite charity until 12pm on thursday
not only giving out money but obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real president  don't fall for it
hurricane is good luck for obama again he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars
i saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm
the water damage to nyc is amazing the winds were bad but the water was worse
all weights are on crane's wrong side  very precarious below move out
if authorities need direct view from top of trump tower call office
we are taking care of hundreds of people in the trump tower atrium they are seeking refuge free coffee and food
so far the hurricane is being handled very well in ny not nearly as bad as stated on news let's see what happens later
many people walked out on madonna's concert when she told them to vote for obama years ago i walked out because the concert was terrible
obama lied 100 percent about libya and the killings emails are absolute he must release his records on wednesday and stop the lies
dave letterman @late_show said during my interview that obama was "probably" born in the us the word "probably" is a disaster for obama
i'm not hearing much from obama or his administration about my $5m offer to charity or to which charity the money will go
i guess @billmaher saw my ratings on the @late_show the other night where letterman beat leno bill you are no letterman
while @bettemidler is an extremely unattractive woman i refuse to say that because i always insist on being politically correct
@bettemidler talks about my hair but i'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body  so i won't is this a double standard
many people are saying that my challenge to obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers  i agree
a lot changed when david letterman said " he was probably born in this country" the word probably is a total disaster for obama
@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy but the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy fight on john
@bernardmcguirk that's more than o'reilly did and he is supposed to be my friend you're terrific
@bernard mcguirk thanks for being so nice and defending me on o'reillyyou're terrific
alertthe president knew that the ambassador was being attacked in benghazi he did nothinghe is no leader
@donnydeutsch tries so hard to be a star but he just doesn't have what it takesand he never will
i put @donnydeutsch on apprentice at his request i did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my obama announcement
i want to end the day by saying there is no check i would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our president
the today show should call me about who to put on the show  i know more about people who get ratings than anyone
i hear they are very unhappy w/ arianna and @huffingtonpost at @aol i’ll bet she won’t be there for long
if obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent what will he say
if my offer is refused every undecided oh voter will be fully aware that obama denied $5m to charity all because he is hiding something
barack obama has everything to gain why would anyone ever deny $5m to charity
i have decided to add a caveat to my offer obama can't decide to send my $5m to rev wright if he releases his records
my fellow tea party friends in ohio make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can gotv election day know you can must win ohio
where's the transparency despite obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with jeremiah wright
looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's dutchess county #gop dinner to a sold out crowd it will be great fun
pretty audacious for obama to call @mittromney a bser when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write
by the way where is @oprah good question 4 years ago she strongly supported obama now she is silent anyway who cares i adore oprah
colin powell thought iraq has weapons of mass destruction
obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester the middle east is a mess yet colin powell still endorses him wonder why
be careful of an obama "bomb" to win election would be a horrible thing to do
the election is still close but trending toward @mittromney he leads all national polls and obama's likeability is imploding vote
wow letterman show @late_show won the ratings last night big time and guess who was his guest djt
what a dumb mistake aol made buying the @huffingtonpost how much longer will arianna last i predict not much
@mikempef thanks i hope you enjoyed it had a great time
stupid arianna @huffingtonpost hired the man who ruined the once great nytimes business section
a real loser named tim o'brien and it's never recovered
dopey arianna @huffingtonpost is really after me boring story after boring storybut i hear she is in big trouble
i knew last year that @time magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their top 100
 i will soon start naming magazines that i think will fold i predicted newsweek
@lianneonlife i love the wounded warriors obama should choose that as his $5m charity
@sabrinasiddiqui re taylor and conor great news for taylor
based on the ovation last night from the letterman @late_show audience i believe it will be hard for obama to throw $5m down the drain
instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause
another great charity that the $5m could go to just a recommendation to the pres the wounded warriors represented so well by @traceadkins
lots of response that obama should give the $5m to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in benghazi
letterman @late_show was great last night i had a lot of fun you could see his audience really wanted obama to take the $ for charity
the dealmaker is cunning secretive focused and never settles for less than he wants the america we deserve
it is really a shame that barack obama may stop $5m from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent
doing david letterman @late_show tonight at 1130 1st nite of sweepsgoing into the lion's den but i've been there many times before enjoy
six days and counting until my offer to barack obama expires
for someone who demanded 20 years of mitt's tax returns you would think my offer to donate $5m to charity for his records is an easy go
i hope derek jeter’s recovery is going well he is a very special player and a great guy new york loves him @yankees
@politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting
what will be the response on wednesday if obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity
@michellemalkin i fully supported mccain but when he lost hoped obama would be great for us  he wasn't
@mark_sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @evalongoria he will always do great
i am offering the chance for barack obama to redistribute $5m to any charity of his choice everyone wins take the deal
@barbarajwalters @theviewtv why did you choose me as one of the 10 most fascinating people of the year last season (and more than once)
@barbarajwalters @theviewtv will apologize to me just like she did when i was right about @rosie besides i get great ratings on the view
@barbarajwalters @theviewtv barbara unfortunately you've missed the entire point of my announcement you just don't get it
still waiting for an explanation about why @giulianarancic and @billrancic did not name their son donald unbelievable
miss universe 2012 pageant will be airing live on @nbc and @telemundo december 19th open invite stands for robert pattinson
excited to announce that @giulianarancic and @bravoandy will be hosting the 2012 miss universe pageant great ratings for miss universe
how does @michellemalkin get a conservative platform she is a dummy just look at her past
i am happy to have started #obamasfavoritecharity really enjoying reading everyone's tweets
just stated by a total pro "you are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking"
glad to hear north carolina is solid for @mittromney it started trending for mitt solidly after my speech at the @ncgop convention
in light the benghazi emails released last night it is apparent that obama has no problem lying to the american public
 by releasing his records he can come clean with the american people and have $5 million go to a charity
obama has no problem leaking national security secrets why can't he release his records especially when $5m is going to charity
i am happy to donate $5 million to a charity barack obama chooses all i am asking is that he is transparent with the american people
i just learned that @politico has no credibility total phonies that don't report the truth a puppet of obama
glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to obama as sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity what does obama have to lose”
third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find and put it out when in fact the response is incredibly positive
my offer to obama is about transparency in 2008 american people were sold on hope and change this our last chance to get the full record
the response has been fantastic actually overwhelming thank you
all predictions re my 12 o'clock release are totally incorrect stay tuned
story will be released today at 12 noon est on twitter and facebook
invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack sun tzu
if you like having the world collapse and being told america is leading from behind vote obama
no wonder @bbc is in such big trouble and boss was just fired they are lost
@bbc should never have played that piece of garbage documentary and yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course
that it was hard not to end up rooting for trump"
thank you to @dailytelegraph reviewer @neilmidgley who stated "'you've been trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters
@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night i only wish mitt was more aggressive
everyone is asking me to speak more on robert and kristeni don't have time except to say "robert drop her she cheated on you and will again"
last night was the first time obama said "we" instead of "i" in respect to bin laden's killing
barack obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after bin laden now he wants all of the credit
my announcement is tomorrow
tomorrow i will be tweeting on only one subject
china will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own
mitt romney must start congratulating the navy seals and military on bin laden’s killing not the president
@mittromney should have been more aggressive last night yet some polls have him winning the debate
when the military informed obama that they had bin laden is there anyone with a brain that would not have said "ok go get him"
lance armstrong fought for 7 years and then just ran out of energy very sad story although they caught him red handedhe definitely cheated
casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent from a director's point of view steven spielberg
no matter what happens in the election @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit he has kept obama in it even with his terrible record
i always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges by stopping he gave his enemies an opening
the debate was pretty even but i thought mitt should have been much more aggressive on obama's failed foreign policy and i mean much more
debate was somewhat hard to watch last night viewership will be way down
i will be doing @squawkcnbc at 730
stop congratulating obama for killing bin laden the navy seals killed bin laden #debate
@mittromney looks much calmer and obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward
bob schieffer will do a great job tonight always treated me fairly
well this is it the final debate let's see how it goes i'll be tweeting live
why don't we ask the navy seals who killed bin laden they don't seem to be happy with obama claiming credit all he did is say ok
i look forward to @mittromney hitting obama hard tonight for lying about benghazi cia told obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs
everybody is asking about my announcement this wednesday concerning barack obama just wait and see
everyone knows i am right that robert pattinson should dump kristen stewart in a couple of years he will thank me be smart robert
obama is an easy target on foreign policy@mittromney has many openings to attack especially when obama starts bragging about bin laden
this is my last election after my election i have more flexibility obama to @medvedevrussiae discussing our nuclear arsenal
obama planted that @nytimes story on iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate he wants libya and china off the table
the brass in #trump tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork i keep the atrium impeccable key to its success
@toure i felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @piersmorgan he drove you insane but of course piers is a lot smarter than you
my son don and his wife vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named spencer frederick very thrilling
i wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy
don't let obama play the iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected be careful republicans
@toure when you are fired from msnbc for your bad ratings and racist coverage stop by and say hello
autism rates through the roof why doesn't the obama administration do something about doctor inflicted autism we lose nothing to try
lots of autism and vaccine response stop these massive doses immediately go back to single spread out shots what do we have to lose
stay tuned for my big obama announcement probably on wednesday 
people are going crazy with my comments on diet coke (soda) let's face it this stuff just doesn't work it makes you hungry
obama should stop talking about wind turbines they are a disaster for a country or community and are very expensive and unreliable
i will be live tweeting during the debate tonight
derek get well soon the @yankees need youl
gas prices are at crazy levels fire obama
they succeed because they think they can virgil
don butler and executives are doing a great job at @cadillac the cars are fantastic
the biggest problem with a rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the yankees he must go
fort hood shooting should be declared a terror attack respect the wounded and dead
good luck to derek on his operation i know it will be a success he is a great champion
derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately it will be lucky for him like in past
derek jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in trump world tower
78 percent unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterdayreal unemployment is at least 15 percent
@mittromney's @rnc convention came in over $3m under budget barack’s @dnc convention is over $10m in debt what a surprise
can't wait for @vanityfair to fold which under graydon carter will be sooner rather than later
@vanityfair's terrible piece on mitt's faith is a new low even for them
where were all the @vanityfair exposes on "when rev wright disciples go to washington" sad
rev @billygraham is a great man and so is his son franklin graham
rev@billygraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the christian community on @mittromney
both barack and @mittromney were excellent at the al smith dinner last night
a lot of the @yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season they are lucky they don't have to deal with george steinbrenner
i hope @boyscouts of america handle their problems a lot better than the board at penn state did you can't do any worse
@rginn_1 toledo is a great place i've been there and worked in cincinnati for 2 years i love ohio
newly released nh poll has @mittromney with a 1 point lead mitt will pull away next week
obama has called libya attack "a bump in the road" and "not optimal" just come clean already tell americans the truth
maybe derek jeter should ask a rod about renting his apartment next year very soon a rod won't need a place in nyc
yes i will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming monday
@katyperry is no bargain but i don't like john mayer he dates and tells be careful katy (just watch)
so many tweets and stories on stewart/pattinson look it doesn't matter the relationship will never be the same it is permanently broken
congratulations to bernie marcus and herman cain @jobcreatorsusa on the #truthtour2012 all employers need to check this out
@lancearmstrong really blew it went down in flames too bad
why would ohio listen to bruce springsteen reading his lines be careful or i will go to ohio and @mittromney will win it
obama said "not optimal" to ambassador and embassy killings bad word usage for a harvard graduate
great decision by donald graham @newsweek to sell i'll now have to take my newsweek covers off the wall
with barry diller and tina brown in charge did anyone doubt that @newsweek would be a massive failure
something really bad happened to the @yankees psyche much like our president
@yankees should get rid of a rod asap i can't watch this guy anymore
@evaemery thanks you sound great
i'll be making a major announcement on president obama next week stay tuned
can't believe we are less than three weeks away from the election time certainly flies
a penny saved is a penny earned benjamin franklin
the yankees are absolutely terrible what happened to this team
hey @rosie how is your recovery going i hope you are doing well so we can start fighting again soon
@crazymom28 i have a friend that wants to meet your sister
the last time i visited china i couldn't believe all the construction you can go up with a project in a week no red tape
it's thursday how much money did barack obama waste today on crony green energy projects
clinton commented in ohio today that @mittromney is right the economy has not been fixed under obamai always said bill was an honest man
when strasburg leaves @nationals for another team for more money will washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good
bad sign for obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states their internals must be horrendous
while the next season of @celebapprentice is packed w/ all stars ours fans will be happy to see @joan_rivers in the board roomshe is back
derek jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment derek only in a trump building trump is lucky for you
now there is talk of a rod being shipped to @marlins if a rod is not a @yankee next year the fans will be happy
i think the @yankees will win today unlike a rod cc is good under pressure i hope a rod plays however
robert i'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump kristen but i'm right if you saw the miss universe girls you would reconsider
@g_harwood because they are either jealous or losers (or both)
newsweek ending print edition sad now my newsweek covers mean nothing they lost all credibility time to follow
@loveandgarbage dopey who went bankrupt you i never did
the biggest thrill in the world is entertaining the public there is no bigger thrill than that vince mcmahon @wwe
@womenzbinder check the records dummy i was never a bush ii fan he is why we have obama
lots of response to my pattinson/kristen stewart reunion she will cheat again 100 certain am i ever wrong
looking forward to honoring the great dogan family and the success of the trump towers project in istanbul @followturkey annual gala dinner
alert us jobless claims up 46000 to 388000 really bad news 78 percent is now a fraud not possible
amazing my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @wsj
when we're talking about math that doesn't add up how about $5 trillion of deficits over the last four years @mittromney
obama's spending and borrowing is burying america and destroying our children's future does he even care
@ashleycam2883 re libya hillary took the blame for obama
mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth
if obama goes after mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then mitt should ask for obama's college records all of them
@mystikangel bring @johnrich back he is back
what is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all we should be given credit for taking this risk
can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight
robert pattinson should not take back kristen stewart she cheated on him like a dog and will do it again just watch he can do much better
michael vick of the philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback
initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped see what happens when i am not mentioned
just read about my friend @hulkhogan he was set up too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles
@billrancic bill you should have named your beautiful son donald
joe girardi @yankees must play his starters even a rod they got you there
while the @yankees look like they quit and are finished they won't quit for cc
obama talks about what he is going to do why the hell didn't he just do it especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary
@mittromney scored last night on both substance and style
bad decisions can be devastating
obama was beaten but not knocked out he lives to fight another day but in the real world presidents are not given a second chance
all the guys that said @mittromney would lose are rapidly coming on board mitt will remember the early helpers
if obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically environmentally and aesthetically
robert bryce @nypost congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines and how destructive they are windmills are a disaster
remember new "environment friendly" lightbulbs can cause cancer be careful the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care
wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds they are killing the finances and environment of many countries and communities
really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @realmicihaelkay i am a long time yankee fan
my twitter followers will soon be over 2 million and all the "biggies" it's like having your own newspaper
my twitter has become so powerful that i can actually make my enemies tell the truth
polls are starting to look really bad for obama looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win don't put it past him
obama did much better than he did last time but still lost decisively
do you believe barack hussein obama (aka barry soetoro) looked like a president last night i don't
obama has zero credibility on oil and coal if we do not win energy as a country we just do not win period
i still love derek he is a winner
remember i said derek don't sell your trump world tower apartmentits been lucky for you the day after he sold it he broke his foot
at the debate the president kept talking of what he is going to do i kept saying why didn't he do it he lost me a long time ago
verlander pitched great but @yankees look truly defeated
stupid george will gave @mittromney no chance 3 months ago take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy
george will said "best debate he ever saw" if you ever heard george will speak(boring) anything is exciting
debate showed these guys really hate each other at one point it looked like they would come to blows 
obama better than last time but again @mittromney wins good night #debate
you talk tough mr president but have done nothing about china killing our jobs and economy
such long rhetorical and boring answers from obama no wonder nothing gets done
@mittromney much better on libya and middle east problems obama has no answer
obama keeps namedropping bill clinton he is no bill clinton
obama weak on immigration all words no action he's been prez 4 years
obama is looking rhetorical and weak @mittromney is looking strong and sharp
obama just said @mittromney was "a very successful investor" big mistake for obama to admit he has less and less credibility
obama keeps saying that he will do something but why hasn't he done it it's all talk
@mittromney looks much stronger and much more presidential
then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices
good response on jobs by @mittromney
why has obama let china and others take our jobs
why hasn't obama created jobs
getting ready to watch the debate as they say "let's get ready to rumble"
i was just told by one of the top @pgatour players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country very nice compliment i agree
we should be able to negotiate a deal with iran because they know we could blow them away to the stone agethey just don't believe we would
for political purposes only obama is planning to hit libya for the benghazi embassy attack right before the election
great win last night by peyton manning and @denver_broncos in san diego coming from 24 points behind on the road very impressive
if the @yankees can somehow beat verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series and i will go to games 6and 7 so they will win
get ready for tonight
@mittromney if obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records and transcripts he will quiet down quickly
good luck @mittromney tonight have no doubt you will be great
congratulations to @jamesokeefeiii on exposing more democrat voter fraud @dnc was caught red handed telling people to vote twice
i bet the terrorists in libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in benghazi
between libya the national security leaks and fast and furious obama has had more national security scandals than any other president
@reince is doing a fantastic job for the republican party hope he gets the credit he deserves
@antbaxter i tried watching but fell asleep
@history's wonderful "the men who built america" with me on tonight at 9 bad timing i'll be live tweeting the debate
because obama was so pathetic in the first debate tonight's audience will be humongous people want to see if he is for real
the coca cola company is not happy with me that's okay i'll still keep drinking that garbage
it's amazing my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @cnbc draw the highest ratings and they get bigger week by week thanks folks
obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row at least he is consistent
diet coke tweet had a monster response dammit i wish the stuff worked
@antbaxter thanks for helping promote and make trump international golf links scotland so successful you stupid fool
@antbaxter your documentary died many deaths you have in my opinion zero talent
i can confirm the reports @billrancic my first season winner will be returning to this all star season of @celebapprentice
@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right it will be a nightmare for @israel if obama is re elected
verlander is great but very beatable does not have a good era in playoff games
i turned down going to the debate tonight so that i could do live tweets to my many followers
i have no doubt that mitt will do really well tonight we'll all be watching @mittromney
lots of pressure on obama tonight even more than a rod if he doesn't perform well it could be over
i hope a rod has a great night for the yankees he owes it to them especially with derek hurt
gov gary johnson pulling votes from @mittromney don't waste your vote obama must go
based on very popular demand i will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the presidential debate
the invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government @mittromney
sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride let time go bydonald j trump
if @mittromney has a good debate tomorrow night obama is finished
once again obama fails to classify china as a currency manipulator he just helped china steal even more jobs and money from us
a rod should donate his contract to charity he doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform he is a $30m/yr rip off
looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @mittromney supporters at the intrepid mitt's doing well
barack obama is not who you think he is most overrated politician in us history
isn't it time that obama release his college records and applications boy would that create a mess he is not who you think
lots of response to my comment on diet coke  let's face it it doesn't work just makes you hungry
a rod was a great player when he lived at trump park avenue even though he was on the juice
derek jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at trump world tower i told him not to sell karma
i love @libertyuniversity such great people
a rod is just not making it we want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great
obama will be trying very hard at next debate he doesn't want to lose the boeing
who says obama will do better in the next debate has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks
@mittromney's poll numbers are looking really good one more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout 
i have never seen a thin person drinking diet coke
no i wasn't at the @yankees game yesterday can't go today either when i go they win
yankees can win today kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher
a rod hit ball hard first at bat time for him to step up and leave
swisher should have caught ball in right field last night
@yankees are in trouble without derek try a rod at short get him some confidence
a bad thing finally happened to derek jeter he is a great champion
so much for washington shutting down strasburg they deserved to lose
roadway steel on beautiful verrazano narrows bridge is rusting and rotting away scrape and paint before too late
tonight despite everything put a rod in the lineup 
everyone's wondering what's wrong with a rod not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore the real reason 
they found jessica in colorado body was mutilated death to the pervert killer
joe girardi did a great job of managing the yankees this series
i'll bet obama goes down just like washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win
washington should have brought in strasburg to relieve they would have won
when strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency washington will say " what were we doing"
i told you whenever i go to a @yankees game the @yankees win
leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality warren g bennis
when an employee leaves me and begs to come back i never let them loyalty is very important
i look forward to tuesday night's presidential debate i wonder if obama will use my name again
very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate
what we are watching on our tv screens is the unraveling of the obama foreign policy @paulryanvp
obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families the price of corn alone has risen over 200 percent since he was elected
with our amazing all star cast @joan_rivers @johnrich @arsenioofficial and @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors
great to hear that our loyal @celebapprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast this will be something special
@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act
i'm going to the @yankees game tonight to root them on they always win when i am there
my scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world a great honor for me
credibility is important to me hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night #vpdebate
doing the @todayshow with @mlauer was great i really like matt
first minister of scotland released bomber of pan am flight #103 on "compassionate grounds" do you believe

obamacare is a complete disaster many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it terrible
wing bangers the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the us

pretty even debate no knockouts however ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger what do you think #vpdebate
biden's statements on medicare are very effective ryan must now come back and combat #vpdebate
excellent story on @mittromney very good moment for ryan #vpdebate
biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching #vpdebate
hard for biden to justify libya mess but doing best he can #vpdebate
both candidates are looking sharp now it's up to the mouth and the mind #vpdebate
get ready this should be informative and fun #vpdebate
looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment
it's thursday and only 26 days until the election how many illegal donations from china and saudi arabia did obama collect today
our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in us history
live tweeting during tonight's vp debateshould be a great time
how the hell does the libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection
why the hell did we help the libyan "rebels" in the first place that is the real scandal
i suspect @joebiden could do well tonight don't be fooled by his gaffes he is a seasoned and feisty debater
if @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish a beater is always a beater just watch
amazing that derek jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well
$30m a year and a rod is now relegated to the bench @yankees would have lost if girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)
i guess they have lance armstrong cold brutal report a waste of taxpayer money to take down an american hero
@apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 730am et on the @todayshow with @mlauer
staff at trump park avenue disliked a rod to put it "mildly" the staff at trump world tower loves derek jeter
asking why my dislike of a rod dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal
great move to take a rod out of game now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs)

i am more concerned about biden in the debate than i am about obama be careful on thursday night
you have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving big bird  @mittromney
a rod must be dropped in the yankees line up tonight if they want to win he simply can't perform without drugs
receiving thousands of thank you letters from @libertyu students for my convocation speech the honor was all mine great people
47m on food stamps over 23m americans unemployed 50 percent of college grads unemployed and obama wants us talking about big bird
has barack obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations media
i just had to fire someone he didn't have a clue he reminded me of obama on wednesday night

it doesn't matter who you vote for it matters who is counting the votes be careful of voter fraud
obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate let's see how he reacts under pressure
remember obama limped across the finish line he should have lost to hillary be careful

the public is about to learn a lot more information on barack obama and his true background in the coming weeks…
now that obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in libya or iran he is desperate
mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post debate shows that the american public can still spot a real winner
with these record high gas prices what does it say about obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate
looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates will be a lot of fun

scary obama's budget deficits are so out of control that he has to borrow 40 cents on every dollar he spends
rt @mittromney i am running for president to get us creating wealth again not to redistribute it
with obama and bernanke destroying the value of the dollar gold and real estate should continue to rise in value
the attack on our libyan consulate was the worst attack on the us since 9/11 time for obama to come clean
despite all of china's cheating they are not doing that well we can beat them our country has great potential
all these polls released by news outlets are oversampling democrats they want to influence public perception of the race
the emmys are all politics that's why despite nominations the apprentice never won even though it should have many times over
amazing race winning an emmy again is a total joke the emmys have no credibility no wonder the ratings are at record lows
the emmys were horrendousthe absolute worst show
with all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy obama should be down by 12 points and he's not

the media is pathetic our embassies are savaged by radicals while obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @mittromney
what a coincidence that obama's good friends in libya and egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies
with allies like egypt and libya who needs enemies
shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11
obama told @nbc that egypt is no longer an ally they used to be until he pushed out mubarak
filming of the record 13th season of @celebapprentice has started be sure to be on the lookout for future updates
if obama was smart he would cancel the muslim brotherhood's wh visit later this month he won't
with the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food
obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster the worst president we have ever had

this is all about american weakness and an incompetent president
weakness cow towing and not standing firm is provocative we are getting pushed around and robbed under this president

those who refuse to draw red line to iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @israel @israelipm @netanyahu

we left iraq and it is quickly falling apart what a waste of lives and money and so obvious
under president @barackobama china has experienced unusually fast gains and america unusually fast losses #timetogettough
he should be ignored @ronpaul's foreign policy is a dream come true for our enemies he has zero chance to beat @barackobama
michele bachmann got less than 1200 more votes in the caucus than she did in the ames straw poll very sad for her a nice woman

the keystone pipeline will create 20000 jobs and make us less energy dependent from the middle east @barackobama says no
the safest way to preserve medicare is with a robust and vibrant economy we should lower corporate and capital gain taxes immediately
my new book #timetogettough is the best present of the holiday season a great gift for anyone who cares about this country
barney frank looked disgusting nipples protruding in his blue shirt before congress very very disrespectful
he is delusional @barackobama believes that he is the 4th best potus ever

china just put a tariff on us cars and trucks 22 percent china is laughing at our inept leaders @barackobama
the lightweight @jonhuntsman used my name in a debate for gravitas it didn't work sad

some @ows protesters are sincere people frustrated with the system others just in for the party
our deficits are caused by runaway spending not inadequate taxing washington does not have a revenue problem

when will @barackobama release an actual budget

if the prez wants to create jobs talk to some business people not liberal intellectuals
the only way to spread economic growth is to lower taxes and end unfriendly regulatory practices
the fed's reckless monetary policy is going to create record inflation
new study shows 80 percent of congress have no business experience it shows
a guy named @bobbeckel on fox their resident liberal was not born with much of a brain

@thecelebrityapprentice cast is set the best we've ever had shooting starts in 2 weeks airs in february
@amandaknox is innocent italian government should pay for this travesty
sadly vanity fair is a rapidly dying magazine needs new blood and fast going the way of spy magazine
the unemployment numbers are tragic we are letting the world take our jobs it has to stop
@barackobama said yesterday that we have "gone soft" how can the world respect us when our own president doesn't
how many more billions of dollars will @barackobama continue to waste in these solar companies
everyone should boycott italy if amanda knox is not freed she is totally innocent
@jonhuntsman called to set up a meeting haven't returned his call
a simplified tax code would spur economic growth and help create jobs unfortunately washington is incapable of simplifying anything
the only way for medicare and social security to remain solvent is if our economy is healthy @barackobama doesn't get it
the iranians have just threatened to send warships to our coasts they laugh at us we can't allow them to develop nuclear weapons
the fed's reckless policies of low interest and flooding the market with dollars needs to be stopped or we will face record inflation
china does not negotiate from a position of strength we simply negotiate against ourselves we have all the advantages but don't execute
really bad ratings for lawrence o'donnell on msnbc o'reilly is killing him

happy new year to all my jewish friends
it seems @barackobama had our tax dollars buy guns for mexican drug lords that were used to kill americans we need answers now
our country's debt crisis cannot be solved by tax increases we must cut government spending
obama care’s taxes vest in 2014 conveniently after the 2012 election coincidence
opec is ripping us off on oil we are ripping ourselves off by investing in unproven green energy #solyndra
our deficit spending is china’s gain @barackobama is bankrupting our country
government waste fraud and abuse should be immediately addressed this will help solve our deficit crisis both short and long term
@erictrump is doing a great job on completing our new trump winery in virginia
@barackobama's jobs plan sure looks like a tax increase plan to me
australia is a beautiful country with terrific people who love america
china is neither an ally or a friend they want to beat us and own our country
our next president must stop china's rip off of america
rick perry is right when he says we must stand by israel in the un
obamacare will destroy small business the backbone of america's economy
if you're going to think think big  the art of the deal
sorry i will miss the cpac gathering in orlando there in spirit obama must go
i find it really hard to listen to @barackobama's speeches he doesn't have a clue
it seems there is never a problem for which @barackobama cannot find a reason for another speech and another tax
how will raising taxes create jobs washington is all out of answers new leadership is needed
i am increasingly concerned with the un's ploy against @israel this coming week and will monitor all events closely from australia
if china had a tenth of the natural resources we do then they would already be energy independent instead we continue to buy oil from opec
it doesn't cost any money to think bigger  the art of the deal
@barackobama great job on solyndra you are some extremely skilled venture capitalist stick to the memoirs and speeches
@barackobama honored and excited to be listed on @attackwatch thanks btw where are the jobs donald
i applaud @netanyahu for announcing that he will show up at the un to defend @israel a true us friend and great leader
we can create jobs in the american economy by protecting our own manufacturing sector
can you imagine if @barackobama had passed cap and trade energy costs would be double from already record highs
the solyndra scandal @barackobama's $500million photo op he loves wasting our money
had dinner with @rickperry last night great guy straight shooter impressive record

bob turner great guy great businessman will be a great congressman was happy to help him win
i'm looking forward to seeing you all this afternoon at macy's herald square 530 pm at the crystal department on 8
@barackobama will hear loud and clear today the message ny 9 is sending by electing @bobturner9th @israel is our friend and ally
the white house is continuing to be openly uncooperative with the fast and furious investigation american lives were lost we need answers
how can the economy ever recover when @barackobama keeps threatening the private sector with more taxes this is no way to spur growth
i'm urging my friends in brooklyn to vote for bob turner tomorrow send @barackobama a message
friends in ny 9 let @barackobama know that you don't approve of his mistreatment of @israel vote for @bobturner9th tomorrow
the american economy would grow if washington didn’t keep threatening higher taxes and more regulations government is not the solution
the world economic forum now ranks the us the fifth most competitive economy in the world we have fallen from first under @barackobama
iran’s nuclear program must be stopped – by any and all means necessary
very exciting i will be at macy’s herald square this wednesday at 530pm to celebrate the launch of trump home crystal
want jobs slash corporate tax rate tax incentives for companies that create jobs in us america will boom
@barackobama the stimulus will fail just like the first
i watched potus speech from europe same old "tax and spend" won't create jobs
why is the un planning to attack @israel's sovereignty and ignore iran's nuclear program the us should look at future funding
china is happy to learn that @barackobama plans to borrow another $300 billion @barackobama is their favorite client
if only speeches could create jobs then @barackobama wouldn't have such a dismal economic record
america needs a tough negotiator not a community organizer
why was @barackobama selling guns to mexican drug dealers
a robust growing economy is how to fix social security and medicare not cuts on seniors
us should have told libya "rebels"  give us 50 percent of your oil for our military support
@barackobama trillion $ stimulus was supposed to create jobs instead it gave us more debt and higher unemployment
@barackobama wishes speeches could create jobs his job is costing america all of ours
fast and furious gun running goes all the way to the white house we need answers now
oil is double the price now compared to last year opec is laughing at @barackobama
fast and furious put semi automatics in the hands of mexican drug lords that killed americans @barackobama should answer all questions
the white house is predicting 9 percent unemployment throughout 2012 – and when obama care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher
make no mistake fast and furious goes all the way to the white house
@barackobama is so inept that i think he simply made a mistake in originally scheduling the joint session on september 7th just sad
we must stand firm against the un's ploy to sabotage israel if the un grants the pa statehood then we must immediately defund it
i'll be on greta van susteren's show tonight at 10 pm on foxnews tune in
libya is being taken over by islamic radicals with @barackobama's open support
china's business interests reach far and wide even domestically within our borders we need to reassess our relationship
the new libyan government should turn over the lockerbie bomber now
obamacare must be fully repealed or it will destroy america's small businesses
if the un unilaterally grants the palestinians statehood then the us should cut off all its funding actions have consequences
if the palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group hamas
crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that opec is ripping us off
@barackobama must release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution
libyan rebels should have given us 50 percent of the oil in return for our military support we don't even ask
more and more americans seem fed up with both parties i agree
there is no substitute for private sector experience
why did @barackobama and his family travel separately to martha's vineyard they love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers' dime
america needs a president who can negotiate better deals for the american people
china's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the american economy with the right leadership it can be stopped
@barackobama inherited $106 trillion in national debt will leave after his first term with the debt at over $176 trillion
there usually is an easy solution to every problem for instance a lot of our country's problems can be solved in next year's election
we have spent over $1 billion on the libya operation what are we getting back
as bad as qaddafi was what comes next in libya will be worse just watch
let's not start celebrating over libya until we see who takes over
we spent over a billion on libya and lead the way why is europe getting the oil
@ronpaul has some serious ideas which deserve serious consideration wrong for media to ignore him
we don't need another stimulus the first one was a complete failure why repeat the same mistake
israel is being barraged by rockets from gaza recently they must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens
@barackobama is sure a master delegator he has sent @joe_biden to china the chinese are laughing at us we must do better
@barackobama’s new job plan will certainly do the following – 1 not create any jobs 2 borrow more money from china 
insurgents in iraq show they can still mount horrifying attacks us wastes trillions
karl rove lost gop both houses of congress and the white house gave us obama
ron paul is right when he says we are wasting lives and money in iraq and afghanistan
@barackobama has a record low 39 percent gallup approval rating why so high
amazing obama speaks market goes down trump tells cnbc he's buying stock market goes up  should not be that way
china is a threat to america they are not our friend
unemployment is plaguing both black and hispanic youths very troubling
@barackobama played golf yesterday now he heads to a 10 day vacation in martha's vineyard nice work ethic
reporters say it's the trump bump i tell cnbc i am buying stocks and the market goes up
economic growth can save social security medicare and america
mike huckebee a great guy said the president should appoint me treasury secretary china and opec would not be happy
ron paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in iraq and afghanistan
obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity he believes in government
it's easy to see why americans are sick of career politicians and both parties
how will mitt romney defend his record on jobs and romneycare in tonight's debate
looking forward to the gop debate and the outcome of the ames straw poll we must get a real leader
the fed continues to flood the market with us dollars wrong move
oil is starting to rise again despite the horrible times opec continues to rip us off not worth $30 new leadership needed
congress should get back to washington but @barackobama doesn't want to interrupt his vacation in martha's vineyard
the sandp downgrade is a direct result of @barackobama's increased reckless budget spending and obama care he owns this
obama care is already having a devastating impact on our economy
america's debt officially became 100 percent of our gdp on @barackobama's 50th birthday coincidence
thanks to giovanni's coal fire pizza of florida for donating enough pizza to feed 750 police athletic league youngsters in ny this friday
watch my interview with greta van susteren on her show on the record tonight on fox news in the 10 pm hour
morning joe panel is stealing many of my statements and ideas to better america without giving credit the story of my life
republicans gave obama a free pass to the white house they just don't get it
i believe america can be great only with proper leadership
wake up america china is eating our lunch
all those politicians in washington and not one good negotiator
no taxes the only good thing about dc debt deal
the more you learn about the debt deal the worse it gets
republicans and democrats have both created our economic problems
why should we have any defense cuts in any deal america must remain strong
this is the best deal the republicans could get
disappointed in gop and dems giving obama power to raise the debt limit next year is a mistake
ex presidential pollster pat cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure
we need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem
no taxes in boehner or reid plan important victory for america
watched sean hannity last night a great guy
if obama has to re fight this fight next year he loses  "watch the fine details in every deal" the art of the deal
blue ribbon commission to find and agree to future spending cuts bad idea
never quit and always hit back the art of the comeback
i just got mike leach's new book swing your sword he's a great coach and he's written a great book it's definitely worth reading
@barackobama has not released his own debt plan yet he's totally lost ineffective desperate gop has its best chance to make a great deal
my wife melania trump's show was a tremendous success last night in case you missed her you can see her again tonight on @qvc at 7 pm et
@johnboehner "the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it" the art of the deal
please tweet me your questions to answer in my #trumpvlog
@karlrove's @crossroadsgps new ad criticizes obama for his excessive spending and debt borrowing from china didn't bush do the same thing
people ask me every day to pose for pictures but the camera never works the first time they are never prepared or maybe just very nervous
know when to walk away from the table the art of the deal
watch my wife melania trump tonight on @qvc at 1 am so proud of her
higher taxes kill job creation cut wild government spending and waste
china has so much of our debt that they can't put us in default w/o killing themselves us needs our toughest negotiator and fast
america's debt is greater than our gdp time for new thinking
fiscal mismanagement of cash costing us taxpayer billions cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for seniors
obama sadly has no business or private sector background and it shows
the answer to both social security and medicare is a robust growing economy not cuts on the elderly
we need a balanced budget amendment because congress has no fiscal discipline
unfortunately@barackobama's continued attack on the us $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things
ronald kessler's new book "the secrets of the fbi" is a great book that should be read by everyone
increasing america’s debt weakens us domestically and internationally us senator @barackobama 2007
the gang of six yet another unmitigated disaster any deal needs to repeal obamacare t e a
china is our enemy they want to destroy us redstate interview
obama is addicted to spending america into insolvency his record proves it
robust economic growth is the answer to the medicare problem not cuts on the elderly
while @barackobama seeks to further destroy our credit our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs such a total failure as a president
so china is ordering us to raise the debt limithow low have we as a nation sunk
the gop doesn't waste an opportunity to waste an opportunity defunding obamacare should be central to any deal
every dollar @barackobama spends costs $140 with interest borrowed from china on our children and grandchildren's backs cut cap balance
@barackobama has sold guns to mexican drug lords while his doj erodes our 2nd amendment rights

@johnboehner mr speaker bring the balanced budget amendment to the floor for a vote let's get the ball rolling
house gop wants to cut medicare obama took $500 billion from medicare for obamacare both wrong
@johnboehner message for house gop "the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it" the art of the deal
if only @obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening israel's borders then america would be on the path to solvency
the art of the deal "the best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you have" cut cap and balance
republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @barackobama in today's debt talks first and foremost cutcap and balance
congress is backtime to cut cap and balancethere is no revenue problemthe debt limit cannot be raised until obama spending is contained
